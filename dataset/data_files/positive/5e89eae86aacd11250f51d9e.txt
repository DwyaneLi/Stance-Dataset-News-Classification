A team of Chinese scientists have identified the complete structure of ACE2 protein, which coronavirus uses to enter human cells, which can facilitate the development of possible antiviral therapies.
The study, published this Wednesday in Science magazine, is signed by researchers from three institutions in China, where the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 disease, was first detected at the end of last year.
"Our discovery not only helps to understand the mechanics of viral infection" but also "facilitates the development of virus detection techniques and possible antiviral therapies", said the authors of the study, cited in the magazine.
The team, led by Renhong Yan of the Westlake Institute of Advanced Studies, analyzed and described the structure of the ACE2 protein, which was not fully known until now.
It is the ACE2 protein that the new coronavirus "kidnaps" to enter human cells.
