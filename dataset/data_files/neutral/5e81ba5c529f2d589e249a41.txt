Moscow, 27 March / Sputnik radio. According to the Russian news agency, the United States surpassed Italy and China in one day after confirming the covid-19 incident, ranking first in the world.
According to Johns Hopkins University, China has more than 85400 cases of infection, compared with 81300 in China.
In the United States, however, there was a decrease of 1288 deaths compared with the total number of cases reported, compared with 3298 in China and 8215 in Italy.
However, experts point out that these figures cannot be compared directly because it is not known which country has a better incidence. In addition, most patients in the United States and Italy have not recovered for the time being, so it is too early to draw conclusions about the outcome of the disease.
The number of cases reported in the United States has increased faster than in Italy, estimated at thousands, while in China it has increased only by a few dozen a day.
According to U.S. authorities, more than 500000 people in the United States have been tested on the Colorado virus.
On March 11, the World Health Organization announced a new outbreak of coronavirus infection with the covid-19 epidemic. According to the latest data of the World Health Organization, 460000 people have been infected and more than 20000 people have died in the world.
