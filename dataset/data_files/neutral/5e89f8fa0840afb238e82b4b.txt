We refer to Mr James Heng Swee Lee’s letter, “Covid-19 crisis: Jetstar should let passengers rebook flights at no cost” (Feb 26). 
 Given the introduction of temporary immigration restrictions as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak, Jetstar Asia has suspended all services to mainland China and Hong Kong. We have also reduced flights to some other destinations where there is a drop in demand as a result of Covid-19. 
 All customers affected by these changes are being offered a full refund or the option to change their date of travel, free of charge. 
 We have provided similar options to our Taiwanese customers after recent travel restrictions introduced by their government. 
 Singapore’s Ministry of Health, however, has not issued travel advisories to many countries in our network, including Japan, and these services are operating as usual. 
 Therefore, if customers choose to cancel their bookings for personal reasons, they are not entitled to a full fare refund, as stated clearly in our fare rules. 
 We continue to monitor this situation very closely and will advise customers directly should there be any impact on their travel plans.
