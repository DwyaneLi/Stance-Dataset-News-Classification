Wuhan, the Chinese city where the first cases of the new coronavirus arose, prepares to temporarily suspend public transport, advances the BBC. The measure is a response to growing concern about the outbreak which, inside and outside China, has already killed 17 people.
Residents were advised not to leave the city, and the decision was made to close the airports and train stations for exit travel.
Bus, metro, boat and long-distance transport networks will cease to operate from the 10h00 local hours (2h00 in Lisbon) of the 23rd day of January.
After the death toll almost doubled in the space of one day, the Chinese authorities claim that the country is now in the "most critical" phase of prevention and control.
"Just don't go to Wuhan. And those in the city, please do not leave,"appealed to the Deputy Minister of the National Health Commission, Li Bin, in one of the first public interventions since the outbreak began.
The closure of public transport takes place in a week when millions of Chinese are preparing to travel, to celebrate the Lunar New Year.
According to the latest update, there are 440 confirmed cases of infection with 2019-nCoV.
