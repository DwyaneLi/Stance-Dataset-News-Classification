Scientists have discovered that coronavirus genetic code resembles in 96% with the infectious disease that bats carry. This epidemic was officially considered a zoonotic virus, i.e. it is transmitted from animals to people.
Wuhan's researchers used samples of seven infected animals and, after the results of the tests had arrived, it was possible to verify the almost complete similarity between coronavirus genetic codes in bats and humans.
Regardless of the latest results, Chinese scientists still do not consider infected bats to be the main culprits for the outbreak of this epidemic that has already killed hundreds of people. In fact, it is still open to the possibility that the first infected has been contaminated by another animal, the intermediary of the coronavirus of the bats.
These and other animals, such as koala, rats, snakes and young wolves, are sold on the seafood market in Wuhan, which, after the outbreak, was closed and disinfected. Although it is not yet confirmed that the animal originated the outbreak, Chinese scientists confirm that the outbreak definitely began on the Wuhan market.
At present, Chinese snakes sold for consumption in this establishment are also included in the list of possible contaminants and intermediaries from this outbreak.
According to the Nature magazine, six of the seven infected patients, who were sampled, were workers on the Wuhan market and were also the first reported cases of coronavirus patients in December 2019.
Currently this epidemic, which emerged at the end of last year, has killed 360 patients and infected nearly 17.500. This Sunday was confirmed the first kill outside China, the Philippines.
