Two fresh cases of the new coronavirus have been detected in India, the government has said. Both the patients are stable and being closely monitored.
In a statement released on Monday, the government said while one positive case of the Covid-19 was detected in New Delhi, the other was reported from Telangana.
The statement added the person from Delhi had travelled to Italy and the other visited Dubai. The health ministry said that both are stable and being closely monitored.
India has so far reported three confirmed cases of the virus, all in Kerala. All three from Kerala, who had tested positive for coronavirus, have recovered.
The three students, all Keralites, had earlier tested positive for the coronavirus on their return from Wuhan, the epicentre of the deadly outbreak that has left over 3,000 people dead in China, triggering a scare in the state.
After the three students tested positive, the Kerala government had declared the coronavirus as a state calamity but withdrew it after effective quarantine and no fresh cases being reported.
As part of the efforts to management of coronavirus (COVID19), passengers are being screened at airports across India.
On India’s efforts to remain protected from coronavirus, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had credited the country’s robust health surveillance system. The minister had also hailed qualified health professionals for "resisting" the Ebola, Nipah virus and Swine flu in the past.
The coronavirus has infected nearly 89,000 people globally and caused more than 3,000 deaths, including 2,912 in China.
The deadly virus, first detected in China in December last year, has spread to more than 70 countries.
