McDonald's group indicated this Wednesday that it closed "several hundred" restaurants in the Chinese province of Hubei, the center of an epidemic of the new coronavirus, indicating that about three.000 of its establishments in China remain open.
The situation remains'worrying', one group leader stressed at a telephone conference following the presentation of financial results.
McDonald's set up a working group to control and prevent the epidemic, reflecting in particular on how to act in kitchens and the delivery of meals to hospital workers.
The group stressed, however, that the impact on its results should be reduced if the epidemic is contained in the country. China represents nine% of McDonald's fast food, but only 4% to 5% of its global sales and about 3% of its operational profit.
The North American Starbucks coffee chain had already announced on Tuesday the closure of more than half the establishments in the country.
In China, the new coronavirus has already made 132 dead and contaminated near 6.000 people, according to the latest balance sheet.
Nearly six.000 confirmed infections show that the number of people affected during the epidemic of Acute Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which reached 5.327 persons between November 2002 and August of 2003, has already been exceeded in China, according to official data.
Today, a case of contagion has been identified by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the United Arab Emirates, the first found in Middle Eastern countries.
In addition to mainland China, cases of infection have been reported in Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, Australia, Canada, Germany, France and the United Arab Emirates.
