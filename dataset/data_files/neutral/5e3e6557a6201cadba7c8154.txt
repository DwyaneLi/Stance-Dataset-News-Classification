In the wake of increasing number of people affected by the coronavirus outbreak in China, Pakistan has started screening passengers at four airports at least where flights and to and from China operate.
Country's national carrier Pakistan International Airline (PIA) took the decision to screen all of its passengers at the Beijing airport.
The consistent spread of the coronavirus in China has prompted many countries to take steps from controlling and blocking its spread in their respective countries.
The spread of the virus has already caused respiratory diseases in animals, birds and humans in China as casualties have been reported and hundreds of cases have already been recorded.
Till now, coronavirus has already taken at least 17 lives while over 650 others have been infected since December 31, 2019, in a market of Wuham city in China.
The virus has also been reported in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Macau, Singapore and the United States.
PAKISTAN'S NEW SCREENING PROCESS
In Pakistan, at least 17 flights land every week and under the new screening process, every passenger from China will have to pass through health counters set up by the CAA at international arrivals, where a doctor and two paramedics will be screening the passenger through thermal body scanning machines and thermometers.
In case any passenger is identified as a virus carrier, he/she will be kept into designated isolation rooms till the time they are shifted to the hospital, where they will be treated and kept in quarantine.
Pakistan has setup the scanners at Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar and Karachi airports.
Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has stated that they are vigilant about the spread of coronavirus across Asia.
