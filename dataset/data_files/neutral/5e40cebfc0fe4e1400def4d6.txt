At least three suspicious patients are also present in the Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Shanghai, as the Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post reported.

It is believed that the virus came from an animal market in Wuhan. So far, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there is "no clear evidence" of a transmission of the virus from human to human. Coronaviruses often cause harmless diseases such as colds, but they also include agents of dangerous respiratory diseases such as sars and Mers.
According to experts, the new pathogen resembles the Sars virus. There are differences, especially with the proteins that the virus attaches to human cells. In the Sars pandemic, 2002/2003 was a disease of lung disease from China around the world around 8000. Barely 800 of them died. (dpa)
