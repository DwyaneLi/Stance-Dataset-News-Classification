Using telemedicine to provide medical assistance remotely.

"In this regard, it is clear that there is a need for the speedy adoption of a bill to expand the power of doctors in remote assistance, That is, the possibility of remote diagnosis and treatment. " This will reduce the number of people entering treatment facilities and help to care for more patients.

" In the case of limited mobility, access to qualified medical assistance should not be denied. This is also particularly important for older people who are particularly at risk. This interim measure should be able to quickly detect potentially dangerous conditions in the early stages of the disease, including coronavirus, And prevent people from congregating in medical institutions "- quote his words from the foundation press office.
The French agency for international development cooperation stands ready to provide expert and organizational support for the drafting of the bill.
Doctor's opinion
This is an important decision in the current epidemic situation, especially in this case, When patients only need to ask questionã€‚ There is a group of people who run on every little thing and ask for expert advice, but in principle they don't need to. Therefore, in some cases, especially in the case of therapeutic diseases, adequate online tutoring, including video tutoring, can be provided -Share with TASS, associate doctor of medicine, associate professor, surgeon oncologist Sergei osminin
According to him, this not only helps to reduce virus infection, including the spread of coronavirus, but also helps to filter patients in the outpatient department, They really need expert personal advice. " I think it's even necessary in this case, because we can assess the patient's condition by phone. Through telemedicine, we can see the vision of a patient, and he can tell us what is bothering him. According to the protocol, we can specify symptom treatment "- add immunocorrection to the general manager of tacis medical center. Hotanova, doctor - physician Lyudmila rapa.
However, doctors point out that the main problem in this area is to take this consultation seriously. " Not every doctor can take on such a responsibility, which actually seems easy. It needs knowledge and experience. The main task is not to hurt, "she explained.
"When the doctor is responsible, he should recommend hospitalization in any dangerous situation, or should still go to see the doctor.About In my opinion, about 50% of requests can be reduced in this way, "osmium concluded.
