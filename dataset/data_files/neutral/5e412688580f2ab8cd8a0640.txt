HONG KONG • Macau's first confirmed case of the Wuhan virus involves a 52-year-old Wuhan businesswoman who reported to hospital on Tuesday, the Chinese territory's Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture Ao Leong Lu, vice-chairman of a committee set up to respond to the virus, said yesterday. 
 The woman took a high-speed train to the Chinese city of Zhuhai on Sunday, and then a shuttle bus to Macau. She had dinner with two friends, then went to a hotel and spent a long time in casinos. 
 She was in a stable condition in an isolation ward in hospital. 
 Meanwhile, the authorities announced that all staff in the city's bustling casinos had been ordered to wear face masks.

 TAIPEI • Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen called on China yesterday to share correct information about a new coronavirus and for the World Health Organisation (WHO) not to exclude Taiwan from collaboration on the outbreak for political reasons. 
 Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to the objection of China, which considers the island a Chinese province with no right to participate in international organisations unless it accepts it is part of China. 
 The deputy head of China's National Health Commission, Mr Li Bin, told reporters in Beijing earlier that experts from Taiwan had been invited to visit Wuhan, and the island was being provided with information.

 HAKONE • A Japanese confectionery shop in the popular hot spring town of Hakone has incurred the wrath of the Chinese for putting up a sign containing offensive content to ban Chinese tourists amid a global virus outbreak originating from China. 
 The owner of the shop in an onsen resort in the popular Yumoto district in Kanagawa prefecture told reporters he had put up the sign last Friday, one day after Japan announced its first case of infection of the novel coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, the Asahi Shimbun news site reported. 
 On the Chinese Twitter-like platform Weibo, netizens are calling for a boycott of the store.
