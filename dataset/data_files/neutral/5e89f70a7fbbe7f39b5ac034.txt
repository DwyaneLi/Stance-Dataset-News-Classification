YouTube has removed 14 videos promoting non-scientific treatments that allegedly cure covid-19, after the Catalonian Audiovisual Council interviewed the technological company about the issue.
On Thursday, in a statement, the Catalonian Audiovisual Council requested the withdrawal of 16-video videos "which alleged to have a remedy for the disease (covid-19) and which attributed the lack of recognition by the health authorities to the interests of the pharmaceutical industry, Since the medicine would be cheaper."
YouTube has already removed 14 videos, while still active two of the 16 reported, which generated 343.223 views, claiming that they violated "community guidelines".
The supposed sponsored remedies included a solution of sodium chloride or chlorine dioxide, for example.
The President of the Catalonian Audiovisual Council, Roger Loppacher, expressed his satisfaction with YouTube's decision to withdraw the videos, saying that these contents were "clearly harmful" to public health.
Loppacher also said he hoped that the two still visible would be "removed immediately", adding that the Audiovisual Council will continue "to monitor the different platforms to detect misinformation or harmful content".
