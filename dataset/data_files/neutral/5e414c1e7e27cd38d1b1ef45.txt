The Macao authorities indicated this Monday that there is currently no transmission of the new Chinese coronavirus on the territory, as all six recorded cases are residents of Hubei Province in central China.
After announcement this morning of the sixth confirmed case of the disease in the territory, the deputy physician of the management of the St. January Accommodation Centre Lei Wai Seng stressed that all cases are imported and the patients are residents of Hubei.
"This means that, so far, there is no transmission in Macao society. We continue to monitor the disease and do not exclude transmission in the community,"added the person responsible at a press conference.
The representative of the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) Wong Kim Hong of the migration department pointed out that the local authorities today refused entry to all residents of the Chinese Hubei province who did not submit a "condition" medical statement.
"After one hour [16h Sunday in Lisbon] no one from Hubei was able to enter Macao" because he did not submit a medical statement stating that they were not infected with the new coronavirus, he said, without giving a number.
On Sunday, the Macao Government had imposed the obligation to submit a medical declaration to any resident of Hubei Province, whose capital Wuhan is the centre of the new coronavirus outbreak (2019-nCoV). At least 80 people have died already in China, registering more than 2.700 infected throughout the world.
This medical statement is not "a simple certificate", advanced Wai Seng Law, and must prove that the person "is not infected and must have spent 14 days in isolation and under medical supervision" in official establishments
Yeah.
This means that non-resident workers who have left Macao to Hubei will also have to submit this medical statement, as well as the residents of the province, and "if they cannot, they will also not be able to enter" the territory, added in the daily meeting with journalists to update information about the Viral pneumonia in Macao.
On the other hand, the CPSP officer indicated that the police highlighted 200 officers to check a total of 86 hotels, aparthotels and pensions, which resulted in "aid to Macao's exit from 144 tourists from the Hubei province".
Four individuals agreed to remain in isolation at the Sana-Haa Youth Hostel, Coloane, one of the two centres set up in Macao for cases under medical observation.
According to a police estimate, about 500 Hubei residents will still be in Macao. PSP is trying to locate these people who, in case they don't want to leave Macao, will have to be in isolation.
In addition to mainland China, cases of infection have also been reported in Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, France, Australia and Canada.
According to the Chinese authorities, the ability to spread the virus has increased and infected people can transmit the disease during the incubation period, which takes between one day and two weeks, without the virus being detected.
Beijing decided to extend the Lunar New Year's holiday period, the main feast of Chinese families, which was due to end on Thursday, to try to limit population movements.
The Wuhan region is under quarantine, which affects 56 million people.
Some countries, such as the United States, Japan and France, are preparing with the Chinese authorities for the withdrawal of their citizens from Wuhan, where two dozen Portuguese are also present.
