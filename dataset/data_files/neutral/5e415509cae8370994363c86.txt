RFM radio this Wednesday clarified that the mood line that left the Chinese community in Portugal "outraged" by references to coronavirus deaths was intended to "satirize" commentators "futile and misinformed" who deviate "from what is important".
In statements to Lusa, the director of RFM, Antonio Mendes, noted that "the satire target" from the Tuesday line of comedian Luis Franco-Bastos "is not China or the Chinese and, much less, the victims of the coronavirus".
"This character, who existed before, wants to satirize'influencers'[social media influencers] frivolous, or misinformed people who comment on issues on the Internet without focusing on what is really important", justified the head of RFM.
Mendes therefore refuses to allow the humour to be targeted at deaths linked to coronavirus infection, noting that Luis Franco-Bastos is "part of the new team of the RFM Morning Coffee, which ripped out the 6th of January, and which also includes Pedro Fernandes, Mariana Alvim, Salvador Matinha and Duarte Pita Negr o".
The president of the Chinese League in Portugal, Y Ping Chow, said this Wednesday that the Chinese community in Portugal is "outraged" by the line and demanded an "apology" from the radio.
In the "Privileged Information" section of the "Coffee in the Morning" program, the character'Gleidson'of comedian Luis Franco-Bastos is questioned by the presenters about the death of 304 people (Tuesday's numbers) in China by coronavirus, and replies: "Wow, what a misfortune. How many more? 378 billion? Oh, less. Even more wi-fi. Whoever survives puts content in the insta easier.
Questioned about the "gravity of the situation", the comedian replies: "Guys, Chinese has a lot. You know how little we need to be careful before it disappears? Tall, handsome, rich and funny man
Yeah. That's a little, you know, it's a species that has to be preserved. Now Chinese? There's a lot. Relax."
In Lusa's statements, Ping Chow highlighted that "humor is interesting, but not everything".
"It may be humour, but it couldn't be done at a time when people are so focused on supporting and calming people who are worried about the virus. It caused a lot of uneasiness in the community and we want to talk to the radio administration,"said the Porto-based businessman.
The item is available on the official page of Louis Franco-Bastos on the Instagram network, where critical comments are multiplied on the humorist's statements.
China rose this Wednesday to 490 dead and more than 24.300 infected with the balance of the pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) detected last December in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province (centre), placed under quarantine.
64 The deaths in China recorded in the last 24-hour period, according to Beijing authorities.
The first person to die from the new coronavirus outside China was a Chinese citizen in the Philippines.
In addition to the mainland of China and the Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, there are other confirmed cases of infection in more than twenty countries, the last new case identified in Belgium.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared on Thursday an international public health emergency, which presupposes the adoption of worldwide prevention and coordination measures.
