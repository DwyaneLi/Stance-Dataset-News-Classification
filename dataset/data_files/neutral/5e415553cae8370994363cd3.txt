The outbreak of the new coronavirus found in China has led health authorities to make generic recommendations to the population to reduce the risk of exposure and transmission of the disease that has already infected more than 17 thousand people.
Here are some of the main recommendations to the population by the World Health Organisation and the Portuguese Directorate-General for Health:
frequent hand washing with detergent, soap or alcohol-based solutions;
-When coughing or sneezing, do it not to your hands, but to your elbow or to a disposable handkerchief which should be thrown out immediately;
-Avoid close contact with fever or cough;
-Avoid direct contact with live animals in markets in areas affected by outbreaks;
-Consumption of raw animal products, especially meat and eggs, should be avoided;
-In Portugal, if you experience symptoms of respiratory disease and have travelled from an area affected by the new coronavirus, authorities advise you to contact Health 24 (808 24 24). If you are going to a health unit, you must immediately inform the safety or the administration.
The World Health Organisation has also been trying to spread facts to combat disinformation and myths linked to the new coronavirus.
Here are some of this information:
-It is safe to receive letters or orders from China, because analysis has shown that coronavirus does not survive long on objects such as envelopes or packages;
-There is no indication that pets, such as dogs and cats, may be infected or carriers of the new coronavirus
Yeah. But you should always wash your hands after direct contact with domestic animals, because it protects against other diseases or bacteria;
-There is also no scientific evidence that garlic consumption will help protect against the new coronavirus;
-Using and adding sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus;
-The current vaccines available on the market for pneumonia did not prevent against coronavirus 2019-nCoV. This new virus needs a new vaccine that has not yet been developed;
Antibiotics are not used to protect or treat coronavirus infections. Antibiotics are used for bacterial and not viral infections. However, hospitalised patients infected with coronavirus may have to receive antibiotics because bacterial infection may also be present;
-People of all ages may be affected by the coronavirus. However, older people or people with chronic diseases (such as asthma or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable to severe disease when infected.
