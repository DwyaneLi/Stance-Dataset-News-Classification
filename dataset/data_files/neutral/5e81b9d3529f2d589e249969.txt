Washington, 27 Russian news agency. The United States ranks first in the world in confirmed new cases of coronavirus infection.
Jones Hopkins University estimates that there are more than 85400 cases in China, compared with 81300 in China. In this way, the United States surpassed Italy and China in one day.
However, the death toll in the United States is far lower than the total number detected - 1288 deaths, compared with 3298 in China and 8215 in Italy. However, these figures cannot be compared directly because it is not known in which country there are more cases, nor in which country there is a better record.
And most of the patients in the United States and Italy have been ill so far, so it's too early to draw conclusions about the outcome of the disease.
In the United States, new cases are increasing rapidly, faster than in Italy, while in China, the estimated number of cases per day is not thousands, but dozens.
Commenting on the news, Donald Trapp said the reason was a large number of studies.
According to Vice President Mike Pence, more than half a million people have protested in Colorado.
