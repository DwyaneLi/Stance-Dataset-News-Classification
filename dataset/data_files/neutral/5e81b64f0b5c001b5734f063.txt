According to the opinion of the world's largest chemical company BASF, the new Coronavirus will place a significant burden on the world economy. "This year we are already experiencing a high level of uncertainty in the world economy in the first two months," said BASF chief Martin Brudermuller on Friday.
The virus added a new factor which significantly affected growth at the beginning of the year, especially in China. The consequences of the measures against the spread of the virus would be a reduction in demand and production losses in many industries, he said, when presenting the annual figures.
BASF expects negative effects especially in the first and second quarters. "I warn against giving premature revelation just because the numbers of patients in China are falling," said Brudermuller. It does not expect the Coronavirus effects to be fully offset over the year.
For the entire 2020-year, the head of the company expects the world economy to grow at two percent slower than 2019. It also expects significantly lower growth rates for global chemistry. "This would be by far the lowest growth since the financial crisis 2008/2009," Brudermuller added.
"If I had to overwrite this, I would throw our team: Kneel! "said the head of BASF. "We are now simply making our strategy, which is the right one. We can't change the environment. But we can make the best of it."
Due to the uncertain consequences of the Coronavirus, BASF has indicated a large range for the annual targets, "This shows the uncertainty". Revenue is expected to rise 2020 to 60 billion euro to 63 billion euro, after 59,3 billion euro last year. For the adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit), the company measures 4,2 billion euro to 4,8 billion euro after a decrease of 28 percent to 4,5 billion euro 201Yeah.
For 2019, BASF wants to spend a little more money on the shareholders than expected. The dividend is to be increased by ten cents to 3.30 euros per share. The profit after taxes and minorities increased 2019 by nearly 80 percent to eight,4 billion euros in the annual comparison. Here, however, was a book profit from the decolonization of the oil and guest daughter Wintershall, up to around 5.7 billion euros.
"2019 was a challenging year with a strong global wind," said Brudermuller. The trade disputes between the USA and China had a negative effect and important markets developed more slowly. In addition, there are uncertainties surrounding Brexit. Demand from many important customer industries had fallen significantly, mainly from the automotive industry.
In order to make the group more profitable, the brother-miller, who has been in office for almost two years, set up a savings program at the end of 2018. This includes job deletions. BASF accelerated the savings rate, said Brudermuller. Now the dismantling of 6000-digit sites is to be achieved at the end of 2020, one year earlier than planned. In return, BASF plans to invest 23,6 billion euros in the next five years.
Last year, BASF merged its oil and gas daughter Wintershall with its rival Dea. The company is expected to go public in Frankfurt in the second half of the year. "We are preparing an IPO," said BASF Finance Director Hans-Ulrich Engel. Whether it comes as planned, however, depends on the market conditions.
The BASF majority participation of Wintershall Dea is the focus for the construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Wintershall Dea is financially involved in the pipeline to transport gas directly from Russia via the Baltic Sea to Germany. The project is a thorn in the United States'side. That is why the companies involved in the pipeline are threatened with sanctions. Construction is currently on icYeah.
"Alternatives for completing Nord Stream 2 are being considered," said Engel. After the construction stopped, Russia had set in motion a special ship for the laying of gas pipelines. At the moment the stop has no concrete disadvantages for Wintershall Dea, Engel said. The pipeline should be completed by the end of 2020.
