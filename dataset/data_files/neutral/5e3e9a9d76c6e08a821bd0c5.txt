On the plane, the overseas Chinese have been examined for health. Spahn, Germany's health minister, said the expatriates who were taken back to Germany were healthy and no one showed symptoms of the disease. However, due to the two-week incubation period of the coronavirus, for health and safety reasons, the overseas Chinese who are transported back to China will be tested and questioned by medical personnel. If someone shows specific symptoms, they will be sent to the isolation ward of Frankfurt University Hospital. The rest will be sent to a German Air Force Base in Rhineland pfartz and quarantined for two weeks. And then allowed to go home.
Spang warned people not to panic, but to look at it with ease. He said he felt a lot of "uneasy" in dealing with the new coronavirus.
There was also an episode in the German evacuation. After taking off from Wuhan, the plane was scheduled to stop over in Moscow. But local authorities cancelled the original suspension. The evacuation plane had to divert to Helsinki to refuel and change the crew. The flight time was thus greatly extended.
Russia's refusal to suspend German planes caused diplomatic unhappiness. Moscow gave the reason that the airport capacity was insufficient. But Germany's defense minister, Krapp callenbauer, hinted that Germany would not accept the explanation and would ask if there were other reasons.
There are seven cases of coronavirus in Germany. They are all from Webasto, a Bazhou auto parts company. According to the company, employees are infected with Wuhan pneumonia after contacting with one or two Chinese employees who come to Germany. Both Chinese employees had symptoms only after returning home.
