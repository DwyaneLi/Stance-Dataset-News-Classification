The spread of Covid-19 and the imminence of a major pandemic can affect global geopolitics and is putting governments before difficult social problems. Analysts heard by Lusa agency believe that a pandemic can create "pandemonium" situations and stress that several rulers fear the future of a global catastrophe. social repercussions of the uncontrolled spread of the virus in a "global village" where phenomena do not recognise borders.
One visible case of this concern is the US President: concerned about the impact of the new coronavirus on his re-election attempt in November, Trump prevented a US citizen, who had been infected on the Diamond Princess ship in Japan, from being treated in his Alabama home state, Calling Republican Senator Richard Shelby to make sure he followed his instructions.
Analysts say the impact of Covid-19 on the US elections may be a "double edged knife": in the first hypothesis, the US economy is affected in the long term, weakening Trump's position, which has used the flag of economic performance; in the second scenario, the outbreak is short-lived, affecting the production of assets for a few months, with the offer to resume on the eve of the election, in a compact way, favoring Trump's position.
According to American Political Journal, Trump has already asked his advisors to examine all scenarios and has requested a detailed report on emergency measures from the CDC. The CDC, in a document that was made public, warned the US President about the risk that "the public health system will become overcrowded, with high rates of hospitalization and deaths", and warned about the impact of a pandemic on transport systemsYeah.
The problem is global and the big variable is to know what size it will reach, says Jose Pedro Teixeira Fernandes, researcher at the Portuguese Institute for International Relations (IPRI-Nova). In statements to Lusa, this expert warns of the risks governments are taking if a pandemic spreads over long periods of time.
"The problem is of degree", explains Teixeira Fernandes, referring to a situation that may involve many thousands of infected people in the same country over a long period, affecting not only health services, but also the supply chains of essential goods.
For the time being, in Europe, where cases of infection are beginning to multiply in various regions, governments are looking for mechanisms to contain the disease by triggering administrative mechanisms to isolate the virus.
Even in France, where there is a strong tradition of individual rights, which make it impossible, for example, for a person who decides to disappear, to be sought by the police, even under the pretext of "family interest", the government has announced that it will make compulsory entry for infected people.
The topic of mandatory admission of an infected patient with a highly contagious virus is being discussed in several countries, including Portugal, where experts are divided in the legal reading of the solutions.
Constantino Sakellarides, a specialist in Public Health and who was responsible for the Directorate-General for Health in Portugal, stated that Portuguese law allows the compulsory quarantine of a patient infected with a virus and even provides for the possibility of declaring a state of calamity, which should be proposed by the Government to the President of the Republic.
On the contrary, Francisco George, who was also Director-General of Health, considers that it will be necessary to make amendments to the Constitution to institute mandatory internment for public health reason" In Portugal, it is time for Members of the Assembly of the Republic to amend Article 27(h) of Article 27(3) of the Constitution to allow compulsory entry for public health reasons. "Unadiable", wrote Francisco George, in an article of opinion recently released in the public diary.
Caroline Barnett, professor of public health at the University of Paris, says the risk of this kind of measure increases with the size of the problem. The problem is when the state seeks mandatory admittance of hundreds or thousands of people, often without ensuring proper conditions for all these internments,"Barnett said to Lusa, referring to a scenario that may occur in several countries in the short term.
For this specialist, an uncontrolled virus spreading situation can lead to a political pandemonium, with several governments having to recognise the inability to deal with thousands of dead people and health-care systems lacking in the means to welcome millions of infected people.
In Europe, the European Commission seeks solutions that are less intrusive than mandatory interbreeding, with mechanisms for isolating the spread of the virus which avoid the need for compulsory interbreeding, in particular by activating the European Civil Protection Pool- an organisation established to expedite coordination of efforts between member countries to respond quickly to disasters.
A major political decision in the European Community concerns the closure of borders in the Schengen area, which the European Commission said this week is not yet being considered. The European Commissioner for Food Health and Safety, Stella Kyriakides, said that the World Health Organisation advised no restrictions in Europe to justify the removal of this solutioYeah.
Mr Pedro Teixeira Fernandes recalls that such a measure goes against the very spirit of Schengen, but recognises that an emergency situation can justify it over a short period of time.
The governments of Italy and France, whose countries border them, have announced that they are aware of this possibility, after the Italian provinces of Lombardy and Veneto have been heavily affected by the spread of the new coronavirus. Moreover, the Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, has been criticised by regional authorities for the most relaxed way in which he has addressed the issue of coronavirus, even criticizing local decisions on school closures and other public spaces.
Conte tried to allay fears that his government might not be able to contain the virus after being forced to admit that a hospital in northern Italy had deficiently treated an infection case, contributing to the spread of Covid-19.
Politically, the most delicate border is the one separating Italy from Austria, two countries which are in open confrontation around the discussion of the European budget and which also seem to have different views on how best to contain the coronavirus. The Austrian Government has already indicated that it would like to see the borders better guarded, but the Italian Government has already said that it sees no reason to suspend Schengen by asking the European Commission to quickly release the fund of 232 million euros to contain the spread of Covid-19.
Diplomatically, the problem is also being used as an excuse to regulate the increasing flow of Chinese tourists in some Asian regions. Singapore authorities are blocking the entry of Chinese into the territory after the Minister of Business and Industry of this territory announced that the tourist area was overly dependent on China, using virus protection measures to justify medium- and long-term measures in moderation of entrYeah.
Teixeira Fernandes recalls that the Covid-19 case is a serious threat to China's position, an early focus of the epidemic, at a time when it is launching its economic expansion programme, especially towards the United States, with whom it has been waging a trade war for almost two years.
The IPRI-Nova specialist also recalls another case of a country in conflict with the United States, Iran, which is also facing a serious problem of spreading the virus, which will also be fragile in the face of its enemiesThe spread of Covid-19 and the imminence of a major pandemic can affect global geopolitics and is putting governments before difficult social problems.
