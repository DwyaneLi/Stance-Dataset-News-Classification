The President of China, Xi Jiping, admitted this Sunday that the outbreak of the new coronavirus in China is the most serious health emergency since the founding of the Communist regime in 1949.
The outbreak of viral pneumonia by Covid-19, which has already affected at least 77.000 people in China, 2.400 of whom died, "is a crisis" and "huge evidence" for the Chinese authorities, he said, in state television statements.
The Chinese President also recognised "gaps" in the response to the coronavirus.
China had already been the starting point for the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003, which killed about 650 people in the country.
By comparison, Covid-19 has proved "very difficult to prevent and control", said the Chinese President at a meeting with the leading leaders of the country.
The Chinese authorities quarantined the city of Wuhan exactly one month ago, where the first cases arose.
The outbreak, which spread to three dozen territories and affects around 78.000 people at this time, has negative effects on the Chinese economy.
Xi Jiping admitted that there will "inevitably be a strong impact on the economy and society", but assured that the effects will be "short-term"
