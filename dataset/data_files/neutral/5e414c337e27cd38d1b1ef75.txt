Portugal has already activated public health devices due to the coronavirus from China and has alerted St John's Hospital in Oporto, Curry Cabral and Estefania in Lisbon, said this Wednesday to Director General for Health (DGS).
At a press conference at the DGS headquarters in Lisbon, Grace Freitas presented the latest numbers of this viral pneumonia and given the increase in the number of infected people in China there is "a great need" to confirm all reported cases, because in addition to the coronavirus there is still less severe influenza virus, And so there's some discrepancy in the numbers.
In Portugal, established protocols for gender situations have been activated, by reinforcing the Health Service 24 line, by means of number 8002424, and the medical support line, for screening and preventing people from filling the health centres and emergency rooms of hospitals in the event of possible contagion.
Grace Freitas pointed out that "there are no suspicious cases in Portugal" of coronavirus infections, and there is no alarm situation, but as a precaution it is "paying more attention" to the seven cases exported outside China.
The Director-General for Health spoke of the most recent figures, which "are constantly changing", and 17 deaths were reported in infected China and 448, with seven of them leaving for other countries.
Most of the remaining 441 originate from the Chinese town of Whuan, where it is thought to be the focus of infection), and there are also cases detected in neighbouring provinces.
Initially the information provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO) was that the virus was not transmitted between humans, but has since been corrected, and so Grace Freitas said that we need to monitor the situation closely.
Yeah.
The same responsible explained that there are international protocols to prevent the virus from being exported from China, with tracing done at source prior to train, plane or boat travel.
In its prevention scheme, Portugal also has a protocol with the High Commissioner for Migration to provide translation services if necessary.
The WHO decided today to extend until Thursday morning the meeting of the Emergency Committee to decide whether the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China is declaring an international public health emergency.
The WHO Emergency Committee, made up of experts from various countries, including Chinese epidemiologists, was meeting today at the headquarters of the organisation in Geneva, Switzerland, without reaching a consensus, and therefore decided to meet again on Thursday, indicated the chairman of the expert body, Didier Houssin.
The new virus causing viral pneumonias was detected in China at the end of 2019 and has already infected several hundred people and caused death to at least 17.
This is a new type of coronavirus, which is transmitted between animals and passed on to humans, and there are already records of individual transmission to human beings, but still in totally substantiated circumstances.
The first cases of the 2019-nCoV virus appeared in mid-December in the Chinese town of Whuan, when people with a viral pneumonia began to arrive at hospitals. It was found that all people were often working or visiting Huanan's seafood and meat market in the same city. The exact origin of the infection is still unknown, but it would have been infected animals, which are marketed alive, transmitting it to humans.
Symptoms of these coronaviruses ar e more intense than flu and include fever, pain, general malaise and respiratory distress, including shortness of breath.
