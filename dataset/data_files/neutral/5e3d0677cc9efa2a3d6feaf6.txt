China has begun to take drastic measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV. The authorities had planned to stop at 10.00 (China, 3.00 time in mainland Spain) all transport of Wuhan, the city of 11 million where the outbreak originated. It was planned closure of the airport and train stations, as well as internal transport network: metro, bus and ferry. The World Health Organization (WHO), which met Wednesday to a committee of experts to decide whether to declare the international emergency will continue on Thursday its deliberations to make the decision because, they say, "More data are needed".
The latest figures, provided by Reuters, said the virus has already affected more than 500 people and has ended the lives of 17, representing a mortality rate of about 3%. Deaths have doubled in just one day. No detailed information of all the victims, but it is known that the vast majority suffered previous pathologies. The closest relation exists, SARS, a viral outbreak that also born in China in 2002, had a mortality rate of 10%. This resulted in almost 8,000 infected and 700 deaths.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO, appeared after the meeting of the emergency committee and applauded the efforts of the Chinese authorities, who are providing information "with all kinds of detail." Before closing the city of Wuhan, it has secured part of the "robust response" China is giving the crisis. "There are only trying to curb the spread of the virus in the country, but is a measure that will also serve to restrain internationally," he said.
There are still many unknowns. Didier Houssin, president of the Emergency Committee explained that to declare the international emergency must weigh many factors such as transmission outside Chinese borders, something that has not yet. "These are measures that interfere with the movement of people and trade and do not want to take them without being sure that they are necessary", detailed has at the press conference in which he explained that the 16 members of the committee were divided into 50 % of the decision. What seems clear now is that the disease is less severe than two other ailments family: SARS and MERS.
The international warning would be the implementation of preventive measures throughout the world, and in the past has been declared on five occasions: before the outbreak of H1N1 (2009), the ebola in West Africa (2014) and the Republic Democratic of the Congo (2019), the polio in 2014 and the Zika virus in 2016.
The WHO meeting comes after a press conference of the State Council of China, announced the hypothesis that the virus has mutated 2019-nCov, complicating treatment. "The number of cases identified is increasing because we have a greater understanding of the disease, better diagnostic methods and mobilized resources," said Li Bin, vice president of the National Health Commission. The growing number of positives could also be attributed to an exercise of transparency by local and regional authorities following the instructions of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which has threatened to punish those who maquillen reality. "Anyone who does not tell the truth be nailed to the pillar of shame for all eternity," proclaimed Monday Chan An Jian, official profile on social networks of the Central Commission for Political Affairs and Legal, supervisor arm of the party in legal matters. Spokesman has assured that the Government has not hidden any data to date and is committed to "continue to provide information until it is no longer necessary".
Yunyan Yang, deputy governor of Hubei Province, Wuhan is located, he said being examined some 2,500 people, of which 863 have already abandoned health centers, according to Europa Press.
Li Bin also recognized that the approach of the Chinese New Year which will take place next Saturday- is a high risk factor for the spread of the outbreak. During the holiday week following the festival, it is customary to visit relatives or travel abroad, resulting in more than 3,000 million journeys, the largest human migration in the world. Therefore, the representative announced the decision "highly effective measures to ensure the development of a Spring Festival [as known to the celebration] harmonious and stable".
Both the Chinese authorities and WHO experts are on the ground in Wuhan. The research is a priority to identify the sources of the virus, and there could be more outbreaks addition to the seafood market Huanan, the original. In this area, where "is marketed with live animals illegally" and quarantined for weeks, it is where the pathogen would have come into contact with humans for the first time, as noted in the press conference Gao Fu, director of the center for Disease Control and Prevention.
The second objective involves know more about the transmission paths of the disease, associated with the respiratory tract and causing symptoms similar to those of an ordinary pneumonia. "We are still gathering information about the virus, the more we know we will be more effective in our action," he said the researcher, adding that "the existence of super-spreaders [highly contagious infection] is not proven".
International airports have begun to take measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus Wuhan. Safety regulator consumer of Russia has announced that it has strengthened its sanitary and quarantine control. So have the British authorities: Heathrow Airport will create separate areas for passengers from regions affected by the virus; Singapore has begun screening all passengers arriving from China. In the United States there are three airports that have established specific controls in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. North Korea directly has closed its borders to foreign tourists.
The measures come to a trickle of cases outside China: Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and the US have confirmed infections in its borders of people who had been at the epicenter of the outbreak town. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Mexico's president, confirmed Wednesday they are studying a patient in the state of Tamaulipas, in northwestern Mexico. "He's under observation." Authorities in Australia and Brazil have also reported suspected cases.China has begun to take drastic measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
