A group of passengers from Shanghai in China refused to board the same flight as 16 tourists from Wuhan after allegedly being seen taking'secret'fever medicines at the airport.
The drama took place this Monday in Japan as the two groups were preparing to return home from Chubu International Airport near Nagoya.
According to the Daily Mail, the group of approximately 70 people demanded that 16 tourists be stopped on that flight fearing transmission of the coronavirus that is leaving the world on alert.
The standoff led to a five-hour delay of the flight bound for Shanghai. Wuhan's passengers, ground zero for the new coronavirus, eventually made it onto the flight after a team from the Chinese consulate in Nagoya mediated.
The coronavirus has killed 106 people- all of them in China- and infected more than 4500 worldwide.
