As concerns spread over the new coronavirus, whose first cases were diagnosed in Wuhan, China, alerts are going up.
In the United States, where the first case was confirmed this Tuesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a guide to healthcare professionals s o that they are better prepared to identify who may be at risk.
The recommendation is that you keep an eye out for anyone with fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, coughing or difficulty breathing, after having been in Wuhan or after having had close contact with someone who is ill and may be suspected of having contracted the virus in the last two weeks.
By close contact, the CDC means the presence of someone within a distance of up to one metre and eighty "or within the living room or area of care" of a person with coronavirus, for a prolonged period without appropriate protective clothing; or "the direct contact with secretions" of someone with the virus.
"Care, living, visiting or sharing an area" with an infected person also fits into this notion of close contact, clarifies the agency.
Recommendations extend to those who experience any of the symptoms mentioned and have been in Wuhan: they should immediately seek out health services by avoiding contact with other people.
Under the name 2019-nCoV, the new virus is particularly dangerous for those with a weakened immune system, such as children or older people, and there is no vaccine that can prevent infection.
Dogs can also contract the virus.
The new coronavirus has already killed 17 people and is changing, the Chinese health authorities confirmed this Wednesday, the day on which the World Health Organisation (WHO) meets in Switzerland its emergency committee to assess whether the outbreak constitutes an international public health emergency.
