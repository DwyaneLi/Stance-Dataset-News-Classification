A patient admitted in a hospital in Salzburg, Austria escaped from the premises sparking a police hunt in the city, reports said. The 31-year-old woman was to be tested for coronavirus.
The unidentified woman snuck out of University Clinic Salzburg around 3 am on Wednesday, an officer said.
The coronavirus outbreak has claimed 563 lives in China so far, with 73 new deaths reported in the past 24 hours.
The little-understood new coronavirus has spread fear around the world, along with the shunning of any suspected to have a link to the outbreak that appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December and has revived fears of the deadly 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS that killed almost 800 people.
