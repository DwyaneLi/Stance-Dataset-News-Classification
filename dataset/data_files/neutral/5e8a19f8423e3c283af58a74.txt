A wind "infected" by the new coronavirus (Covid-19) caused panic among residents of the city of Luena, Angolan province of Moxico, who were said to be "apprehensive, fearing for life".
Interviewed this Friday by a local Catholic radio station, several residents claimed they began receiving messages about the 03:00 on the spread of "toxic wind" associated with Covid-19.
"It really happened, it was around 5:00, when I heard the neighbors screaming for everyone to wake up in fear of being hit by the wind in their sleep," William Kuhahamica told radio.
Rebecca Victor also "awakened in panic" after being contacted by family members, with recommendations that "she had to be awake" on pain of being "affected by the toxic wind in her sleep".
The scenario of fear of the residents of the neighborhoods of Luena was also described by Caetano Luis, noting that "many people awoke waiting for the contaminated wind".
In turn, the head of the Moxico Department of Public Health, Balde Bernabe, appealed to the population by stating that "false information" originated in the neighbouring Republic of Zambia.
"This is a rumour going on in the Republic of Zambia. They're just rumors that have nothing to do with the coronavirus. What is this machine that will produce a toxic wind? It is a myth and the population should remain calm,"he said, in statements to the Angolan Catholic broadcaster.
Angola has contingency plans and control measures at the main entry points of the country and has decreed, from March 03, a ban on the entry of foreign nationals from China, the centre of the Covid-19 epidemic, South Korea, Iran, Italy, Nigeria, Egypt and Algeria, countries with indigenous or registered cases of the new coronavirus.
However, on Wednesday, the Angolan authorities decided to remove the ban list from Nigeria, Algeria and Egypt for reporting only one caseYeah.
The Covid-19 epidemic, which may cause respiratory infections such as pneumonia, has already caused more than three.450 deaths and infected over 97 thousand people in 85 countries, including thirteen in Portugal.
In addition to the three thousand deaths in mainland China, there are reports of fatalities in Iran, Italy, South Korea, Japan, France, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Thailand, the United States, the Philippines, Spain, the United Kingdom and Iraq.
