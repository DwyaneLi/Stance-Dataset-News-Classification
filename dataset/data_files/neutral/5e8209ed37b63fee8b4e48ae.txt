It is tough to avoid a global economic fallout when governments around the world are trying their best to contain raging novel coronavirus pandemic.
More than 1,30,000 confirmed cases have been reported while the virus has claimed over 4,500 lives. In such a scenario, a government is almost entirely focused on ways to protect citizens.
Some hard decisions that are likely to have a long-term effect on the global economy have been taken by governments of affected nations in order to protect citizens.
Simply put, governments have had to pass orders stopping important economic activity including tourism, trade and manufacturing, production and much more.
Though it is not possible at the moment to calculate the total economic damage caused by Covid-19, it will have significant economic fallout, many noted experts, including International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Economist Gita Gopinath, have said.
ADAPT, OVERCOME
Gopinath recently wrote a blog where she mentioned that the world has suffered due to the virus, especially due to shocks in supply and demand stemming from the health crisis.
She goes on to say that substantial targeted policies are needed to back the economy during the course of an epidemic.
Gopinath also explains that while businesses and firms around the globe cannot escape unharmed, they should be ready to double-up and recover once the outbreak fades.
"The goal is to prevent a temporary crisis from permanently harming people and firms through job losses and bankruptcies," she wrote.
Since there is no vaccine to contain the virus, countries have resorted to measures like travel restrictions, temporary school closures and quarantines. Gopinath said such measures can work well during the crisis and put less economic pressure on the existing health systems.
ECONOMIC IMPACT
The financial impact of novel coronavirus pandemic, though cannot be determined by any single economic indicator, has been widespread. The financial distress caused to China, the worst affected country that is slowly recovering, has been the biggest blow to the world.
Several parts of China, which is considered the world's manufacturing hub, were put under strict restrictions when the outbreak was just identified.
Within a month, the death toll and the number of infected people shot up sharply. The Chinese government was forced to lock down factories, prominent stores and other brands. It led to huge economic losses around the world and was reflected in stock markets around the globe, especially Asian countries.
Many reports predicted that global GDP would take a massive hit as lockdown in China would lead to large-scale supply disruptions.
"The economic impact is already visible in the countries most affected by the outbreak. For example, in China, manufacturing and service sector activity declined dramatically in February. While the drop in manufacturing is comparable to the start of the global financial crisis, the decline in services appears larger this time-reflecting the large impact of social distancing," Gopinath explained.
In her blogpost, the IMF chief economist warned about the financial effects and spillovers due to the Covid-19 pandemic. There could be a rise in borrowing costs and financial conditions could also tighten.
Since most countries around the world will face economic shock at the same time, the economic impact of the virus could take a turn for the worse.
HOW TO LIMIT FALLOUT
While it is not possible to completely avoid the economic fallout caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak, the IMF chief economist said targeted economic policies will be needed to shore up economies after the outbreak fades.
"Considering that the economic fallout reflects particularly acute shocks in specific sectors, policymakers will need to implement substantial targeted fiscal, monetary, and financial market measures to help affected households and businesses," Gopinath opined.
She goes on to say that households and businesses hit by supply disruptions could be "targeted to receive cash transfers, wage subsidies, and tax relief" to help them meet daily needs and sustain businesses.
Giving an example of crisis-hit Italy, Gopinath said the country has extended tax deadlines for companies in affected areas and broadened the wage supplementation fund to provide income support to workers who have been fired due to the virus outbreak.
Korea, meanwhile, has introduced wage subsidies for all small merchants and increased allowances for homecare and job seekers. China, for the time being, has waived social security contributions for businesses.
Gopinath said that central banks should also be ready to provide "ample liquidity" to banks and NBFCs, especially those who lend to small and medium-sized enterprises. Such enterprises are usually not prepared to deal with a health crisis of such magnitude.
"Governments could offer temporary and targeted credit guarantees for the near-term liquidity needs of these firms. For example, Korea has expanded lending for business operations and loan guarantees for affected small- and medium-sized enterprises," she wrote
"Financial market regulators and supervisors could also encourage, on a temporary and time-bound basis, extensions of loan maturities."
Gopinath also recommended broader monetary stimulus such as policy rate cuts or asset purchases, both of which can boost confidence and support financial markets.
She, however, said these broad-based fiscal relief measures, should be effective when business operations begin to normalise.
