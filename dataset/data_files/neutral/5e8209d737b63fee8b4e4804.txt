To prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus, scientists and researchers have constantly emphasised that washing hands with soap at frequent intervals is necessary. But do you know the number of times a doctor has to wash hands after treating patients infected with the Covid-19 disease, which is caused by the virus?
A video shared on Twitter by China Global Television Network will answer this question. To begin with, doctors, who treat coronavirus patients, wear protective suits and multiple gloves. In the video, a doctor washes her hands firstly and then, takes off her shoe covers. She washes her hands again and takes off the first layer of gloves, and then, does the most obvious. Wash her hands.
After unzipping her medical gown, she again, washes her hands. She, soon after, takes off the hat of her medical gown and rigorously washes her hands. Well, in this manner, she washes her hands after every step of taking off her medical suit. Thus, the number of times she washes her hands, ultimately rounds off to eleven.
So you see, a doctor washes her hands eleven times after completing work.

The novel coronavirus, which originated in China's Wuhan city in December 2019, has turned into a global outbreak so much so that the World Health Organisation has declared it a pandemic. More than 1,75,530 cases have been recorded in 145 countries while the number of deaths worldwide crossed 7,000.
