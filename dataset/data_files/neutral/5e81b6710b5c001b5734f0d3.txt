According to a media report, the organizers of the world's largest mobile radio fair MWC in Barcelona want to advise on a cancellation of the event due to the Coronavirus risk. Many important exhibitors had previously announced that they would stay away from the fair this year.
The Spanish newspaper "La Vanguardia" wrote that the topic was to be addressed at a regular meeting of the GSMA mobile service provider organisation in Barcelona. The GSMA did not initially comment on the report. She had last weekend stressed that the fair should be held despite the Coronavirus threat as planned by the 24th. to 27. In February, however, additional protective measures will be taken.
In recent days, however, further cancellations have accumulated. On Tuesday alone, Chipgiase Intel, the US telecom company AT&T and the Chinese smartphone provider Vivo announced that they would stay away from the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in view of the Coronavirus risks this year.
Large exhibitors such as Sony and Amazon, the telecom equipment manufacturer Ericsson, the South Korean electronics company LG and the chip manufacturer Nvidia had previously cancelled.
The organisers had announced, among other things, additional cleaning and disinfection measures following the first cancellations. Furthermore, all travellers from the Chinese crisis province of Hubei will be denied access to the MWC. People who were in China must provide proof that they left the country at least 14 days ago.
