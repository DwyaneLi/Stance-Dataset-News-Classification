In February, the Chinese manufacturing industry experienced a sharp drop, more than expected, despite efforts to contain the Covid-19 outbreak, which damaged the second largest world economy, according to official data released this Saturday.
The information made public by the National Statistical Office fell from the 50-points recorded in January to the 35,7, on a 100-point scale and in which figures below 50 indicate contraction of industrial production.
The data were made public at a time when the stock markets around the world are being shaken by the fear that the spread of the new coronavirus that emerged in central China in December will worsen globally.
In addition to Wall Street losses and Asian stock markets, European stock exchanges have accumulated falls from more than 11% during the week.
Uncertainty caused investors to look for assets considered safe, such as the dollar and debts from countries with strong economies, such as the US and Germany, while oil has been steadily falling.
The Covid-19 outbreak, detected in December in China, which may cause respiratory infections such as pneumonia, caused at least two.916 deaths and infected over eight thousand people, according to data reported by 57 countries and territories.
From infected people, over 36 thousand have recovered.
In addition to 2.835 dead in mainland China, there are reports of fatalities in Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan, the Philippines, France, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Two Portuguese crew members of a cruise ship are hospitalized in Japan for confirmation of infection.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the Covid-19 outbreak an international public health emergency and increased the risk to "very high".
