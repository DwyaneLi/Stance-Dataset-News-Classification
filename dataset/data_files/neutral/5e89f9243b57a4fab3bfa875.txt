UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has admitted that the coronavirus epidemic initially detected in China represents "a very dangerous situation" for the world, but has ensured that it is "not out of control".
In an interview with the Associated Press News Agency (AP), Guterres said that "the risks are enormous and the world needs to be prepared".
The leader of the United Nations recalled that the spread of the virus in countries with "less able health services" would require a lot of international solidarity.
Egypt recently announced the first confirmed case of the virus, increasing fear of the spread of the epidemic on the African continent.
The outbreak of the disease, which the World Health Organisation called Covid-19, has already infected more than 73.000 people around the world, and only today, China has reported new cases and more 98 deaths.
Thus, the number of deaths in mainland China caused by the coronavirus increases to 1.868 as the total number of confirmed cases rises to 72.436.
Travels to and from the central region of China, the most affected by the epidemic, were considered the reason for the initial cases of Covid-19 confirmed abroad.
Meanwhile, Japan, Singapore and South Korea have identified new cases that have no clear links to China or patients already known.
The UN Secretary-General is in Pakistan on a visit which includes attending a conference on 40-year-old Afghan refugees, war-torn.
