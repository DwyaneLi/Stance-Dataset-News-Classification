QURANTINE: OUR BEST BET TO FIGHT Covid-19
There are basically two ways in which this can be achieved--quarantine and isolation. Though often used interchangeably in media reports, these terms refer to unique situations. Quarantine is the separation of people who are suspected of having being exposed to the infection, while isolation refers to separation of the infected person(s) (i.e. confirmed cases) from the general population.
Similarly, hundreds of Indian nationals who were evacuated from China following the coronavirus outbreak too were put in special quarantine facilities set up in New Delhi. In China, many affected cities have been turned into quarantines to contain the spread of coronavirus outbreak.
With 26 new Covid-19 cases, health officials in Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh are working on a war-footing to trace all people who are likely to have come in contact with these confirmed cases. Once they are traced, they will be placed under quarantine for at least 14 days.
The infected patients have meanwhile been put in isolation for recovery and to contain further spread of the viral infection.
NEED A SENSITIVE TOUCH
While putting people in quarantine has proved to be effective in controlling epidemics triggered by communicable diseases, it is important that the process is sensitive enough to ensure that those who are being put in quarantines don't suffer mental agony. It is important for health officials and society to ensure that people put in quarantine and isolation aren't stigmatised or made to feel that they are being treated like criminals.
"When individuals are viewed as potential threats to public health, they may feel unfairly attacked and stigmatised," Mariner writes.
For this, the researchers reviewed 24 studies that were conducted in 10 countries to understand the psychological effects among people put in quarantine during epidemics like Ebola, SARS, H1N1 influenza pandemic, MERS and equine influenza. (SARS and MERS are two other known forms of coronavirus-related viral infections.)
The study notes that quarantine is often an "unpleasant experience" for those who undergo the medical process. It says this separation from loved ones, along with fear and anxiety of uncertainty over status of the disease (i.e. whether the person is infected or not) can create "dramatic" psychological effects, including suicide.

QUARANTINE: THE IMPACT IT CAN HAVE ON MENTAL HEALTH
A 2008 study on people quarantined for suspected exposure to SARS showed that about 20 per cent (230 of 1,057 participants) reported fear, 18 per cent each reported nervousness and sadness, and 10 per cent reported having guilt.
In another study, researchers found that some people who were put on quarantine showed signs of stress and depression even after three years, and that about 9 per cent of the quarantined people showed "high depressive symptoms".
Thus, while all people put in quarantine may not necessarily report these signs, it is likely that some may.
WHAT CAN CAUSE STRESS IN QUARANTINE
In technical terms, factors that cause stress of any nature are called stressors. When we talk about people who are put in quarantine during an epidemic, these stressors can be of varying nature.
People who are put in quarantine can develop fear that they may end up contracting the infection/disease. The uncertainty of the status of disease is another factor that adds to this fear.
Example: Quarantined parents may become fearful that they may have infected their children. This fear in turn has the potential of developing into guilt among the quarantined. It can get heightened when people in quarantine show any symptom related to the infection, even though they may actually not be infected.
Quarantine is also a period when a person can't carry out his/her daily routine due to the restriction in movement. In some cases, this can result in boredom, while in others it may be trigger stress over possible financial loss on account of inability to work.
Daily wagers (labourers, street vendors, rickshaw pullers etc) become the most vulnerable to this financial stress if they are quarantined for a long period. In case of coronavirus, the quarantine period is 14 days, which would mean no earning for this entire period. This puts considerable mental and financial stress not only on the quarantined person, but also on his/her family members.
While the above stressors are likely to subsume in the days following the end of the quarantine period, what also causes mental agony is the stigma that society attaches with any infectious diseases, especially ones that become epidemic and require people to be separated from general population.
India and many other developing societies have battled against such stigma in cases related to tuberculosis (TB), leprosy and even AIDS. Patients of TB carried the stigma for rest of their lives. Those of leprosy faced the worst. They were ostracised and left to die in ignonymity. AIDS patients continue to face similar discrimination. Governments have spent crores of rupees but change in societal attitude has been slow.
In fact, three of the quarantined healthcare workers reported that they were unable to resume work because their "employers expressed fear of contagion".
Similarly, a 2015 study on people quarantined for Ebola epidemic in Liberia suggested that the stigma could "lead to disenfranchisement of minority groups", making them more vulnerable to discrimination and ostracization.
QUARANTINE IS NEEDED: THIS IS HOW WE ALL CAN HELP
This doesn't mean nothing can be done to mitigate these adverse effects of quarantine. The government, family members, the media and society in general can play important roles in making people's stay in quarantine/isolation stress free.
The following are some interventions that we can make:
For the unorganised sector, the government must announce emergency measures to win people's confidence that their daily wages during the quarantine period will be taken care of by it. The government can consider paying quarantined daily wagers the wage promised under the MGNREGA.
Such measures would diminish the chances of people from socially and economically marginalised sections hiding their illness. Economically vulnerable people tend to live in clusters where personal hygiene is not given priority. These clusters of habitations have been found to be more susceptible to a contagion outbreak.
Meanwhile, employers in the organised sector need to assure their employees that the quarantine (or isolation) period on account of coronavirus will not affect their salary.
A failure on part of the government and the employers on this count has the potential to result in a situation where people who are infected or those who have been exposed to the infection would not report themselves to medical facilities owing to the fear of loss of income. If this happens, it will prove to be catastrophic.
