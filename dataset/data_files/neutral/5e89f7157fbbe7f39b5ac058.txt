An extraordinary meeting of the leaders of the 20-largest world economies (G20) to address the pandemic of the covid-19 is taking place on Thursday by video conference, confirmed this Tuesday the UN, which is calling on international representatives to take determined measures to respond to the current crisis.
On Monday, the Economic Ministers and the governors of the central banks of this group of the twenty most industrialised and emerging countries in the world undertook to draw up an action plan to coordinate the response to the covid-19 disease and to set out measures to address the consequences of the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus.
The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, wrote to the G20 leaders asking for'coordinated and determined'actions to address the global crisis caused by the covid-19 disease, both in health and in economic and social terms.
In the economic field, the UN has warned that the crisis will cost many billions, which is why it is asking the G20 for a massive injection of resources into the system and for it to forget traditional economic rules and policies, as the world is going through'unprecedented times'.
"I urge G20 leaders to consider the urgent launch of a large coordinated package of billion-dollar stimuli to respond to the direct supply of resources to companies, workers and families in countries that cannot do this alone," Guterres said.
The UN Secretary-General also emphasised that such expansion measures must be accompanied by a rejection of protectionism.
The G20 consists of the United States, Russia, China, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey. It also includes Spain as a permanent guest country, and the European Union (EUYeah.
