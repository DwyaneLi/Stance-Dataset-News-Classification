Two aircraft repatriated U.S. citizens detained in Wuhan this Wednesday, the epicenter of the new coronavirus epidemic in China, announced the U.S. State Department.
The two flights carry more than 305 passengers in total, raising the number of people repatriated from Washington by air to "more than 500", according to the US authorities.
A first flight, with 195 people, left Wuhan last week. All passengers have been placed under mandatory quarantine, to an unprecedented extent in the country since the 1960s.
"All travellers have been subjected to analysis at the airport before departure" and will be placed on "medical observation" after arriving, authorities said.
"The State Department continues to work with China to arrange one or more additional flights to Americans wishing to return to the United States from Wuhan", he added.
There's one more flight scheduled for Thursday.
The U.S. Army is ready to house a thousand people who will be quarantined.
