According to the announcement of the epidemic prevention and control headquarters of the new coronavirus in Wuhan on Thursday morning, the temporary closure and shutdown of Wuhan Airport Station and the city bus were aimed at effectively cutting off the way of virus transmission and curbing the spread of the epidemic. The headquarters appealed to the citizens not to leave Wuhan without special reasons.
However, the mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, who had accepted the Xinhua News Agency on Wednesday, said that "sealing the city" means that people who have abnormal body temperature and may be infected by a new coronavirus will not enter or leave the city, instead of entering and leaving more than 10 million people living in Wuhan. Zhou Xianwang said that people infected with the new type of pneumonia should not enter or leave, and there should be no greater pressure on other areas to prevent and control.
The mayor of Wuhan stressed that Wuhan is the thoroughfare of nine provinces. It is predicted that about 30 million people will flow during the Spring Festival, which will greatly increase the difficulty of epidemic prevention and control. At present, it has resolutely banned large-scale activities and the gathering of people, cancelled the travel group to domestic and foreign countries, prohibited the transportation of all kinds of live birds and wild animals into the city, and cracked down on all kinds of illegal transportation.
He acknowledged that the South China seafood market is the opposite teaching material of Wuhan's urban management, which needs to be summarized.
In addition, the Wuhan municipal government issued a notice to announce the prevention and control of the epidemic of new coronavirus infection, and decided to implement the control measures of wearing masks in public places in the city.
The implementation scope includes public transport, shopping malls, restaurants, gymnasiums, swimming pools, museums and other public places. It is required that operators of public places require customers to wear masks before entering the place, and clear prompts shall be placed at the entrance of the place.
The authorities also said that state organs and employees of enterprises should wear masks when they are on duty, and if someone does not wear masks to enter the site, they should make dissuasion, and those who do not listen to dissuasion should be dealt with by the relevant competent departments according to law. If a person is obstructed from performing his duties, the public security organ shall punish him according to law and investigate his criminal responsibility.
