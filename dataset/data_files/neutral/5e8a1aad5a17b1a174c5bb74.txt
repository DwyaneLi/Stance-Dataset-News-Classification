The Executive Committee of TAP will implement measures to reduce and control costs, including the suspension or deferral of investments and hiring and the "implementation of temporary leave programmes", according to a note sent to the workers.
"We will implement a set of initiatives aimed at controlling and reducing costs such as suspending or postponing non-critical investments, cutting ancillary expenses, renegotiating contracts and payment periods, anticipating credit from suppliers, suspending new workers'contracts and payment periods, As well as the implementation of temporary unpaid leave programmes", it reads in the note sent today and to which Lusa had access.
The Executive Committee led by Antonoaldo Neves justifies the measures with the impact that the Covid-19 outbreak is having on the company reserves.
In the same note, TAP tells employees that "the evolution of the coronavirus outbreak has also had an increasing impact on the global economy, the tourism and civil aviation sectors being the most impacted".
According to the executive committee, "in January and February there was no negative impact" on the business, but "in the last few days there has been a significant drop in reserves, with direct impact" on sales.
Therefore, the TAP has decided to implement measures for the "supply adequacy" and "careful management of the cash position, in order to continue to maintain the necessary liquidity that the activity requires", reads the note.
The airline will therefore cancel about a thousand flights in March and April, "reducing capacity in 4% in March and 6% in April, which represents a total of about 1.000 flights", explained the company in a statement today sent to the editorial offices.Yeah.
According to this note, the cancellations "focus especially on the operation for cities in the most affected regions, especially Italy, but also include the reduction of supply in other European markets that show the largest fall in demand, such as Spain or France", including "some intercontinental flights, given the model operation of TAP, as a long-haul company and connection".
The carrier has ensured that it will "contact all passengers affected by these cancellations and together with them you will find the best options and alternatives for making your travel".
TAP Group reported losses of 105,6 million euro in 2019, an improvement of 12,4 million euro against the losses of 118 million registered in 2018 by the airline, reported TAP SGPS on February 20.
The Covid-19 outbreak, detected in December in China, which can cause respiratory infections such as pneumonia, caused about three.300 deaths and infected more than 95 thousand people in 79 countries, including nine in Portugal.
From infected people, more than fifty thousand have recovered.
In addition to three.012 killed in China, there are reports of fatalities in Iran, Italy, South Korea, Japan, France, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Thailand, the United States of America and the Philippines, San Marino, Iraq, Switzerland and Spain.
A Portuguese crewman of a cruise ship is hospitalized in Japan for confirmation of infection.
In Portugal, the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) confirmed nine cases of infection.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the Covid-19 outbreak an international public health emergency and increased the risk to "very high".
