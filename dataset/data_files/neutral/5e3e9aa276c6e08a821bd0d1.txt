According to our French report, a new coronavirus appeared in Wuhan, China, which belonged to the same virus family, which was at least 700 deaths in 2003 (Sass), and has spread to Japan and Thailand outside Japan.
What is the current understanding of coronavirus in the medical community? In this regard, Agnes, a French journalist from the RFI science and Technology Department of France radio, invited a famous microbiologist from the University of Paris to make a brief introduction: "it is indeed a new virus, a coronavirus. This family of viruses is common in humans and usually causes mild respiratory infections. This time, the new virus should have existed for hundreds of thousands of years, just like all viruses exist in the wild. It may have existed for a long time, but it was the first time to infect human beings through an unusual contact. "
Our French French correspondent then asked whether the source of the disease has been traced to animals, or even more likely to be fish, because a (South China) seafood wholesale market in Wuhan is the source of human infection. In this regard, the famous French microbiologist talked about his personal view: "I personally think that it is unlikely to be fish. The virus is more common in mammals and birds. But it's probably a fish eating animal, it could be a cat or a rodent or something. But there is no information on the origin of the virus. "
The above is an interview by microbiologist of University of Paris, France, with a French journalist from Taiwan, France and Guangzhou on coronavirus.
