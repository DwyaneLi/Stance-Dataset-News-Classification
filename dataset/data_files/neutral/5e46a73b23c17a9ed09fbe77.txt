As the rapid spread of coronavirus that originated in China spread around the world, questions over the cure for the deadly global health scare has grown.
Experts on Thursday spoke to India Today TV as they answered questions on the coronavirus outbreak.
While answering a question of a viewer of India Today TV if there is a cure for coronavirus, Director of National Chest Centre Dr Bharat Gopal said vaccines are "already in the pipeline".
"Vaccines are already in pipeline as per the medical reports are available. But, it is not something that we are looking at in a month or so because it requires rigorous trials to put it to human use," Dr Gopal said.
Speaking about the treatment of coronavirus-affected patients, Dr Gopal said: "There have been case reports where already existing drugs used for HIV have used in different mixtures and combinations along with the flu medications. Few patients have shown good recovery to this and the reports of coronavirus have become negative faster than the others. So, I think, there is a randomised trial which is slated to begin in the next few days in many hospitals in China. A lot of work medically has been done. WHO has already sent its team to China and I think there are going to put all the efforts to find a cure."
The World Health Organisation on February 5 said there are "no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV (virus) and the WHO recommends enrolment into a randomized controlled trial to test efficacy and safety", news agency Reuters reported.
China's central Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, reported 242 deaths and nearly 15,000 fresh cases on Wednesday, said Mi Feng, a spokesperson with the National Health Commission according to news agency PTI.
The total deaths from the more than two-month-old virus outbreak as reported on Thursday stood at 1,367, with the total number of confirmed cases mounting to 59,804.
