Plague
Plague ( Rodents (Yersinia pestics) and fleas living in them have been found in small animals since 1894. It is transmitted to people through the bite of contaminated fleas, direct contact with infected materials or through air drops.

About The lungs - the most severe and the least common plague - are accompanied by damage to respiratory organs. Without treatment, the disease can lead to serious complications and death)（ In the fight against plague, the effective treatment of antibiotics and maintenance therapy. If not treated, the disease can lead to death in the short term.

The fight against the disease was officially announced in 1980. Only two laboratories - the Russian National Science Center - have the right to preserve the virus and conduct research.

cholera
Cholera is an acute intestinal infection caused by Vibrio cholerae, which is characterized by gastrointestinal damage, Destruction of water salt exchange and dehydration.
