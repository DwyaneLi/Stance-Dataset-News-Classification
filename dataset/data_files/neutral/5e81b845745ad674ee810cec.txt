Tuesday morning, 930am. Along the Via Emilia in Italy there is little traffic and this is unusual for a weekday. There are usually many small transporters and trucks on the former Roman road. The Bassa Lodigiana, south-east of Milan, in which the Lombardy host of the Coronavirus has settled, is a very productive economic area. Three.400 companies, including the international group Unilever, and 170 livestock farms are quarantined in the ten municipalities alone.
The first barrier to be reached from Milan via Emilia is that of Casalpusterlengo. 15.200 people live here. The barrier is already four kilometers ahead, in a suburb. Two police cars are blocking the pass. Three policemen and one policewoman, all with oral protection, stand guard, let through small transporters and cars only after the driver has submitted the approval issued by the prefecture.
In the parking lot next to the lockdown, a woman watches the whole thing for a while and then shakes her head: "Let's hope the ghost is over soon," she says. Annalisa doesn't want to mention her last name, is around fifty and lives in the provincial capital Lodi. She is here because of her 80-year-old mother, who lives in Codogno, that is, in the community from where the Coronavirus spread to the other nine quarantine sites. Annalisa took two bags of food to the roadblock today and handed them over to the security forces. On the other side stood her mother, who was given the bags." No, it's not that there's a shortage of food in the restricted zone, but I feel safer taking care of my mother myself."
Annalisa is not an isolated case, says one of the police. Friends, children, relatives with full shopping bags keep coming over the daYeah. To do something for the people behind the lockdown is also reassuring." At the weekend, just after the closure of the red zone, the situation here was temporarily tense too,"says the official. Some would not have wanted to accept that they were not allowed out, others wanted to go in to get their laptop quickly." Today, the situation seems calmer and, in general, the population is responding very responsibly."
This is also what Elia Delmiglio, the 25-year-old mayor of Casalpusterlengo, sees, whom we reach by phone." It is a surreal situation that we are experiencing here,"he says at the beginning. The everyday life has changed drastically." The cafes are closed, you can't go to work, the weekly market is canceled. Only pharmacies and grocery stores are open."However, his fellow citizens are well cared for. In Casalpusterlengo there are seven supermarkets, three butchers, seven bakers and daily supplies. At the weekend, the supermarkets were too crowded, but now everything is back to normal. The fact that people would only be allowed into small groups was purely a security precaution and for their own good." As I said, there is no emergency, either with regard to food, or with regard to petrol or money at the ATMs,"Delmiglio repeats.
But not everyone seems to agree with him. Pietro Meazzi, for example, a worker from Casalpusterlengo, described the daily newspaper La Repubblica as a completely different situation. In the communities of the red zone you have to stand for hours in order to be able to shop, and then when you are finally in the shop you are often faced with empty fruit and vegetable galleys. That's why he organized with some friends and together they would buy for themselves and older citizens in the nearby, non-quarantined village of San RoccYeah. It is not difficult to avoid the barricades, instead of driving along the road you take the field roads. You can't just lock people up.
The authorities also know that there are several escape routes along the fields, and that is why the fences around the quarantine area from 15 to 35 and the security forces deployed have increased to 500. Not only policewomen and police officers are employed, but also Carabinieri, financial police and armed forces. Those who break the rules risk a fine and up to three months in prison.
Coordination of the food supply of the 50.000 inhabitants of the quarantine area is the task of the prefecture of Lodi." It also issues transit permits for suppliers,"explains Pietro Foroni, member of the Lombardy Regional Council and responsible for civil protection. He also reiterates that so far none of the ten communities lack food." I also know this firsthand, because my parents live in the red zone."In every community there is a Comitato operativo Comunale (Coc), a local civil protection task force, to which citizens could turn at any time:"Coc employees also take care of those patients, tested positive for the corona virus but showed no symptoms of disease and are therefore quarantined at home. For these they do the shopping or get them the necessary medicines."The message, however, which is particularly dear to Foroni, is this:"We have carried out 3.500 tests in just four days, France in the same period just 400."Of course, this is how you come across more positive casesYeah.
Walter Ricciardi, special advisor to the World Health Organization at the Italian Minister for Health, pointed out last time that "of one hundred people affected by the virus, eighty of them self-cured, fifteen serious accidents and five fatal ones: 95 percent of patients are thus recovered". The situation has also been described by the health ministers from neighbouring countries Germany, Austria, France, Slovenia, Switzerland and the competent EU Commissioner Stella Kyriakides. And so, at the end of their meeting in Rome, they decided not to close the borders for the time being.
Meanwhile, the number of patients tested positive continues to rise: throughout Italy, there are far more than 300s, most of them in the Lombardy and Venetian regions, and eleven deaths. The other infections in Liguria, Tuscany and Sicily were all patients who were recently in Lombardy. No one can say at the moment how long the red zone will remain closed and where it still needs to be closed. But people worry, one way or another.
At the end of 2019, China reported to the World Health Organisation, WHO, the incidence of pneumonia of unclear cause from Wuhan. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-nCov. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. It is now known as Sars-CoV-2 (CoV stands for Coronavirus, Sars for respiratory disease caused by a similar pathogen).
Sars-CoV-2 may have spread from a food market in Wuhan. It also sold exotic animals such as reptiles. The lung disease that the new virus can cause is now called Covid-19 (English for Coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is called zoonosis, a disease caused by an animal pathogen. Parts of the viral effluent of Sars-CoV-2 of the same pathogens affecting batYeah. The new virus may have been transmitted to humans via an unknown intermediary.
Both the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of 2019 about 2.500, and every third party has died from it.
Overall, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause colds.
Medical practitioners assume that the virus is transmitted from person to person mainly by drip infection.
The WHO recommends general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.
More than 200.000 cases of Corona worldwide (stand 18. In addition, there is a high dark number, which researchers suspect roughly somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all cases. Several thousand people have died as a result of this worldwide. In most cases, however, the infection is very mild. Among the victims of death are, in particular, people with serious illnesses and elderly people.

There's no way to say for sure yet. The WHO shared on 28th. In January, approximately one fifth of those reported as infected become seriously ill by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. Meanwhile, the WHO treats the disease as a pandemiYeah. Various states have imposed entry and exit restrictions to slow down the spread.
Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Countries around the world have reported cases of infection, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccinations. Initial clinical studies with vaccines have begun, i. e. few patients are given a test vaccinationTuesday morning, 930am.
