The Minister of the Economy said this Wednesday that there were no'concerns'regarding the supply and stockpiles of products in the pharmaceutical sector and ensured that the emergence of new cases of Covid-19 will not'change radically' these circumstances.
"I had just the day before yesterday [Monday] a meeting with a number of sectors of the Portuguese economy and the pharmaceutical sector and in this area, there are currently no concerns about supplies and stocks," said Pedro Siza Vieira.
The Minister, who spoke to journalists in the margins of a visit to the CEiia-Centre for Product Engineering and Development in Matosinhos, also assured that the Government is "prepared to respond and support businesses" and that the situation will continue to be "calmly" managed.
"We will continue to manage the situation calmly, make the relevant decisions on the basis of the best information available and realise that one more case today, ten tomorrow, will not radically change at this time the circumstances that are present," he said.
Questioned by journalists whether there was any protocol of support, in particular for companies, Pedro Siza Vieira stressed that although this is not a "serious" disease it is "very contagious" and that the aim now is to "contain its spread".
"The more we can contain the spread of the disease, the fewer people will be sick at the same time, the fewer people will be burdening our health services and the less economic impact this disease will have", he said, adding that the new case of the Covid-19 outbreak in Portugal, like the others, has been contracted outside the country.
"This case is like all others, the case of a person who came infected from outside, what we continue to try to ensure is that we can contain the speed of spread of the disease," he concluded.Yeah.
