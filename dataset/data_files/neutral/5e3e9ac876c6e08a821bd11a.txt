Concerns about the outbreak prompted multinationals to suspend operations in China, the Wall Street Journal reported today. With the Chinese government's full control of the new coronavirus, many multinational companies operating in China are closing stores, reducing business and restricting travel. At present, the number of people infected with the virus has exceeded that of SARS nearly 20 years ago.
The latest outbreak comes before the Spring Festival holiday, when the virus is believed to have first appeared in an animal and seafood market in Wuhan. In just a few weeks, the virus has spread rapidly, killing more than 130 people and infecting more than 6000 people, most of them in mainland China. As of midnight on the 29th, official data showed that more than 7000 people had been confirmed and 170 died.
The report said that some large multinational companies are restricting people's travel to China, and airlines have suspended many flights. In China, tens of millions of people are affected by government action restrictions. In addition, as a precaution, U.S. employees returning from China are required by their companies to work remotely for several weeks.
According to the financial times today, China's coronavirus epidemic hit multinational enterprises in China. As China's coronavirus epidemic becomes more and more serious, international companies, from airlines and automakers to technology and consumer groups, have cut back on their business in China.
According to the report, the impact of the coronavirus crisis on enterprises has widened. British Airways became the first major global airline to suspend direct flights to and from China on Wednesday, followed by Lufthansa and its subsidiaries, Swiss Air and Austrian Airlines. Starbucks said it had closed nearly half of its 4300 stores in China, as well as hundreds of McDonald's restaurants and dozens of H & M and UNIQLO stores. Chinese officials say the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has risen to 132, while the number of confirmed cases across the country has risen to 5974
。
Zhang Ming, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government backed think-tank, warned on Wednesday that the coronavirus could reduce China's first quarter annualized economic growth rate below 5%, marking a sharp deterioration in the trend of gradual economic slowdown in recent years, the report said.
Some countries are in the process of evacuating their citizens from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Japanese and American charter flights took off from the central Chinese city on Wednesday morning.
With the increasing attention paid to the impact of the epidemic on global travel, large airlines are among the companies most affected by the crisis. IAG, the parent of British Airways, has fallen more than 10 per cent since mid January, while European rivals Air France KLM and Lufthansa have also been hit.
Six provinces in China have notified non essential businesses to delay resuming operations after the Spring Festival holiday. These include Jiangsu and Guangdong, two technology manufacturing centers that are critical to the global supply chain. Large technology groups with factories in Jiangsu or Guangdong include Foxconn and Pegatron, the two largest iPhone assemblers, Murata and Japan display, Japanese component and machinery manufacturers, and Samsung and LG, the South Korean electronics giants.
The auto industry, which has multiple factories across China, has also been particularly affected, the report said. Carmakers such as Japan's Toyota and South Korea's Hyundai have remained closed. Japanese groups such as Honda and Nissan, as well as French groups such as PSA Peugeot Citro ë N and Renault, have begun withdrawing foreign employees.
Even auto production facilities outside Hubei Province have been affected, as some component manufacturers are located in the province.
According to reports, global consumer brands have also been forced to stop part of their business in China.
Starbucks said it had closed 2000 stores. Fast Retailing, a Japanese fashion group, has closed about 100 UNIQLO stores in Hubei Province, while H & M in Sweden has closed 45 stores
。 Apple warned on Tuesday that the outbreak had a potential impact on its supply chain. The company widened its revenue guidance range to account for uncertainty. Other foreign companies, such as HSBC, Standard Chartered, LG Electronics and Facebook, have suspended or restricted staff travel to China.
