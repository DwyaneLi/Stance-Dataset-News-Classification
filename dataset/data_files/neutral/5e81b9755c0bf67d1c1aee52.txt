Volkswagen is closing most of its plants in Europe due to the spread of the Coronavirus for probably two to three weeks. VW chief Herbert Diess announced on presentation of the annual balance sheet. Production interruptions are therefore already taking place this week in plants in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Slovakia.
In recent days there had also been first confirmed cases of infections with the pathogen of lung disease Covid-19 in German plants. The works council in Wolfsburg was concerned about this: while in the office area at VW employees could keep their distance from each other because of the Corona epidemic, the

It is too late for the works council: "We now expect an orderly exit from production." In addition, the management would have to submit detailed plans for the individual works, wrote Osterloh and his deputy Daniela Cavallo to the staff. This includes, in particular, the Zwickau plant, where colleagues set up the ID system.

In China, where the Coronavirus pandemic broke out and Volkswagen had to close factories for a while, the situation finally relaxed again and factories were able to resume production.

In China, delivery figures rose again in March, Diess said, but "in Europe and globally, the crisis is still ahead of us". Details of the individual breaks of the plants in Germany and Europe would be announced promptly by the respective group brands. Diess stressed that his group could "draw on what we have learned in China in terms of sanitary and organisational measures" when it comes to production restrictionsYeah.
