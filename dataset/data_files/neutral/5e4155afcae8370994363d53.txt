American technology giant Apple announced this Saturday that it will close all its stores in China by February 09 due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus that has already made 259 dead in the country.
The company announced its intention in a statement cited by the agency France-Presse and based on the precautionary principle and the latest indications from health experts.
China raised to 259 dead and nearly 12 thousand infected the balance of the pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) detected at the end of the year in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province (centre).
All the new 46 deaths occurred in Hubei, the central province of China which is the focus of the outbreak that began in December.
In addition to mainland China and Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, there are more than fifty cases of infection confirmed in 24 other countries, with new notifications in Russia, Sweden and Spain.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared on Thursday an international public health emergency (PHEIC) because of the outbreak of the new coronavirus in China.
An international public health emergency requires the adoption of worldwide prevention and coordination measures.
This is the sixth time the WHO has declared an international public health emergency.
To declare it, the WHO has considered three criteria: an extraordinary situation, the risk of rapid expansion to other countries and the demand for a coordinated international response.
