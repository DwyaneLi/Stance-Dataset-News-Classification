SINGAPORE - As Covid-19 spreads far and wide, and new challenges await the healthcare industry here, what China has shown is that the coronavirus disease can be contained, said infectious disease expert Dale Fisher, who was in China in February as part of a joint World Health Organisation (WHO) mission to review the country's response to Covid-19. 
 In Wuhan, where the disease was first detected, temporary hospitals were built to house the mildly-sick Covid-19 patients, as it became clear that about 80 per cent of the patients had a mild form of the disease.
