Analyses of the two new suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus (2019-nCov) in Portugal were negative, the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) said.
In the note, the DGS recalls that these two suspicious cases had been referred to the Curry Cabral Hospital in Lisbon on Tuesday.
These two cases, which raise to four suspect cases in Portugal, are two Portuguese men with forty-44 years of residence in the Greater Lisbon area.
One of them was a contact of the German group of infected citizens in the course of a training in Germany, provided by an employee of the company who travelled from China for this purpose.
The first case of suspected infection with the new coronavirus in Portugal was reported to 26 in January in a man returned from China who was under observation at Curry Cabral Hospital because he suspected infection with the new coronavirus, which occurred last December in Wuhan. The second was met by a foreign national who was admitted to the hospital in San Joao, Porto, on 31 in January.
On Tuesday, at a press conference, the Director-General explained that 40-year-old Portuguese citizen was placed under surveillance on his return to Portugal and that it was the monitoring system that allowed early detection of symptoms.
Twenty people are being admitted to Curry Cabral Hospital after being repatriated from Wuhan (China), where the virus came last December.
The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which emerged last December in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, central China, has already caused 490 deaths and infected more than 24.300 people.
In addition to mainland China and Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, there are more cases of confirmed infection in 24 other countries
