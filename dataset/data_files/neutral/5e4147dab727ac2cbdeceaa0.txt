The results of the analyses of the 20 citizens who arrived in Lisbon this Sunday, repatriated from China because of the outbreak with the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has already infected more than 17 thousand people and killed 362, were negative. Most diagnosed cases and almost all deaths (except one) occurred in China, mainly in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. This is where the outbreak started.
The Directorate-General for Health (DGS) confirmed, by means of a statement, "that the laboratory tests carried out by Insa [National Health Institute Dr. Ricardo Jorge] were all negative". The public had already ascertained this information before.
The material used for analysis (zaragatoas) was collected on Sunday after a National Reference Laboratory (Insa) team for carrying out these analyses went to Pulido Valente Hospital and Health Park, where the repatriated 20 have been installed and "where will remain in prophylactic isolation for 14 days". During this time they will not be able to receive visitors.
Pulido Valente Hospital is one of the units already prepared by the Ministry of Health to receive Portuguese displaced persons from the Chinese city of Wuhan who request to be quarantined, as it is not mandatory in Portugal. Compulsory admission is only provided for mental illness or extreme cases of public health risk, but it is necessary for the court to decide.
On Friday, the Director General for Health, Grace Freitas, had advanced that in addition to Pulido Valente Hospital (13 individual rooms), also the Port Military Hospital is prepared to receive some of these citizens. Availability that remains, although the health authorities have chosen to arrange ten individual rooms in the Health Park, for logistical reasons
Yeah. The lab running the analysis is in Lisbon.
At the press conference this Sunday, Health Minister Marta Temido explained that the 20 citizens accepted the proposal of the national health authorities to stay in the two hospital units in prophylactic isolation. Grace Freitas had already pointed out on Friday that they are housed in wards, although they are not sick. If such a scenario changes, the protocol will be activated which, in the light of a positive analysis, will move the patient to the Curry Cabral Hospital (Lisbon), which is one of the reference units for this situation.
These citizens, including two persons of Brazilian nationality and two Portuguese diplomats who were in Beijing and who travelled to Wuhan to follow the process of repatriation of the Portuguese, arrived Sunday night at Figo Maduro Airport, "having been evaluated by the doctors of the International Sanity Team, coordinated by the DGS."
"Citizens will continue to be accompanied by two International Health Doctors, who will ensure active surveillance twice a day and will always be available for contact," said the DGS in the statement. The information is already coming in Sunday night at a press conference led by Health Minister Marta Temido. A new press conference is held in the Ministry of Health on Monday afternoon, where a new situation will be made.
