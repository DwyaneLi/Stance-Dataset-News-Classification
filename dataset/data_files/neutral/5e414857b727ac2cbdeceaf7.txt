The World Health Organisation (WHO) postponed its decision to Thursday on whether or not the new pneumonia virus is a global public health emergency. On Wednesday, the WHO emergency committee met in Geneva, Switzerland, but Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the WHO, announced earlier this evening that further deliberation on on the existing data was still needed. If a global public health emergency is declared, this will be the fifth time this has happened in recent years. More than 540 cases of this viral pneumonia originating in China, a new coronavirus (designated 2019-nCoV) and 17 deaths, have already been confirmed.
At the press conference early this Wednesday evening, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus began by saying that this is an "emerging and complex" situation and praised the detailed presentation of data by China. Despite stating that there was "an excellent discussion" during this Wednesday's meeting, he said that more information is needed. "I have decided to ask the emergency committee to meet again tomorrow afternoon [this Thursday] to continue the discussion," he said.
To justify this, the WHO Director pointed out: "The decision on whether or not a global public health emergency is declared is something that I take extremely seriously and that I am only prepared to do with proper consideration of all evidence."
Mike Ryan (director of the WHO emergency programme) stressed that public health actions need not begin with the global public health emergency declaration. "These actions are already well under way." He also warned that the priority is to find the source of how the virus is being transmitted among people. "The main issue is to limit the transmission from human to human.
."
Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of the WHO Emergency Diseases Unit, also reported that there is evidence that transmission from person to person takes place during close contact, such a s between family members or in health care environments. "This is not unexpected in a respiratory illness. But we have no evidence that a subsequent transmission will occur as a third or fourth generation transmission,"he said, adding that no secondary level of transmission was observed in countries where the virus was exported either. That is, from an infected person traveling from China to another country and there has been a new infection.
According to the WHO, a global public health emergency is defined as "an exceptional situation that is determined because it constitutes a public health risk to other states due to international transmission of the disease and because it potentially needs a coordinated response at international level". All this means that, in this case, the situation is considered to be serious, sudden, unexpected and requires immediate action at global level.
The official investigation of this viral pneumonia began on the 31 of December 2019, when the WHO representation in China was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause. These cases had been detected in the city of Wuhan in the Chinese province of Hubei.
The very next day a fish and live animals market in Wuhan was closed, where the outbreak began to be detected, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. Preliminary investigations had revealed that some cases were diagnosed in workers or visitors who visited the market, "where illegal wild animals are sold", says Reuters agency. The WHO even states that the source of this outbreak is likely to be animal. Marketing of live birds and wild animals in the city was prohibited
Yeah.
9th January reported the first death related to the outbreak: a man of 61 years with other associated health problems. And the January 10th authorities announced that the virus was a new coronavirus, a group of viruses that causes respiratory infections in humans and animals and is transmitted by air (through cough or sneezing) or by physical contact. If some coronavirus only results in a cold, others may cause more severe respiratory diseases such a s severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
Andrew Rambaut, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh (Scotland), quoted in a newspaper Science, published on his Twitter that this new coronavirus bears a similarity to SARS in about 89%. The latest SARS outbreak also began in China and more than 8000 and 800 deaths occurred between 2002 and 2003 around the world.
The Chinese health authorities have also confirmed that the new coronavirus is transmissible between humans. Symptoms of this pneumonia include fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Quoted by the BBC, Li Bin, Deputy Minister of the National Health Commission of China, said at a press conference that there is evidence that the disease was "mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract", but has not yet been able to ascertain its exact origin. The British newspaper The Guardian also highlights that it is the poorest people who are most at risk of being infected.
In China, there are already cases in major population centres such as Shanghai, Macao, Hong Kong and Beijing. 13th of January, the first case was announced outside the country: it was detected in Thailand. However, infected people have been identified in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States.
Yeah. The passage of the virus to the United States was identified in a man of 30-year-old Washington state after returning from a trip to Wuhan, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

There have been more than 540 cases of infected people (including healthcare workers) and 17 deaths have been reported. Based on the trips to Wuhan, a group of scientists from Imperial College in London have estimated that there are already 4000 cases of people infected with the new coronavirus in Wuhan.
There is also some fear that this viral pneumonia may spread further during the Chinese Lunar New Year festivities, which begins next Friday (24 in January). This is a time when millions of Chinese travel because of celebrations. The country's authorities have already appealed to people not to travel to and from Wuhan. "Basically, they're not going to Wuhan. Since those in Wuhan do not leave the city, please,"Li Bin requested. The Chinese authorities have also assumed that the country is now "in its most critical state" of prevention and control of the virus.
The last time the WHO declared a global public health emergency was in 2019 for the Ebola virus outbreak, which is still ongoing in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has already killed more than 2000 people. The WHO also considered the following epidemics as international public health emergencies: in 2016, the Zika virus; in 2014, the previous Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which killed more than 11.000 people between 2014 and 2016; in 2014, polio; in 2009, swine flu (the H1N1 virus).
