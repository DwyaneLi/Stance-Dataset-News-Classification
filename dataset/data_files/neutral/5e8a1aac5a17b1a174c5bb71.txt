The 64th session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women was reduced to a one-day procedural meeting only with representatives of the Member States'missions because of concerns about the new coronavirus.
The formal session was to take place in New York between March 9 and 20 and would celebrate the 25th years of the Beijing Platform for Action, the 20-years of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, the five years of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals, and the ten years of UN Women.
For the Vice-President of the European Women's Lobby and President of the Portuguese Platform for Women's Rights, Ana Sofia Fernandes, Reducing the session of the United Nations to a procedural meeting is'deeply disturbing'at a time when the recognition of women and girls' human rights is progressively weakened.
"Supported by the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, women's organisations and feminist groups have been a driving force for change, playing an important role in advocacy in advancing legislation or mechanisms to guarantee the human rights of women and girls", said Ana Sofia Fernandes in a statement.
Also in a public statement, Gwendoline Lefebvre, Chair of the European Women's Lobby, considered that although the political declaration and the multiannual work programme were adopted at the meeting replacing the 64th session of the Commission on the Status of Women of the United Nations, civil society organisations for women from around the world "will miss a unique moment to bring the collective voices of women and girls in all diversity to the international political table"Yeah.
This situation, he contends, caused by external circumstances, "is devastating to thousands of women's and feminist organizations around the world, many of which small ground organizations have financed their trips to New York with scarce resources, now lost".
Gwendoline Lefebvre considers that the United Nations should take proactive measures to support feminist women's organisations, to ensure that they are financially included and supported in the forthcoming UN processes in 2020, including the Forums of Generation Equality in Mexico and Paris and the UN General Assembly in New York.
To date, it explains Gwendoline Lefebvre, the United Nations and UN Member States have not yet been clear in proposing other ways in which the voices of women's civil society can still be heard in the context of the 64th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.
In 2019 the European Women's Lobby, whose national coordination is the Portuguese Platform for Women's Rights, made a statement at 2019 calling on governments around the world to reaffirm their commitment to the Beijing Platform for Action (PAP), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (ODS).
