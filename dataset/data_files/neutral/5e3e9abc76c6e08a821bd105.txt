According to the Hong Kong Ming Pao report, the U.S. expert model infers that the coronavirus kills 65 million people every year and a half, and the U.S. expert assumed the situation of the outbreak last October and expected it to spread around the world in six months.
The report points out that the infection of pneumonia caused by new coronavirus in Wuhan in China has attracted the attention of the international community to cope with the epidemic. An American expert passed the infectious disease model in October last year, assuming that once there is a small outbreak of the coronavirus, it will spread rapidly and kill 65 million people in 18 months. This model has attracted more attention recently. Experts involved in the simulation said that the model aims to reveal not only the impact of the epidemic on public health, but also the economic and social impact. Global public and private institutions need to strengthen cooperation in response.
"I've always believed that the virus most likely to trigger a new outbreak is the coronavirus," said Eric toner, a senior researcher in internal medicine and emergency medicine at the Johns Hopkins Center for health and safety on Friday
The report said that the Johns Hopkins Center for health and safety cooperated with the Gates Foundation and the world economic forum in October last year to conduct a simulation epidemic exercise, in which Tona also participated. In the event 201 exercise, 15 government, business and public health leaders participated in the exercise to make decisions in different policy options under the epidemic situation. The model assumes that a coronavirus named caps, which is more lethal than SARS, can spread easily like a cold, but no vaccine has been developed, and can spread rapidly to cause a global pandemic. According to the results of the exercise, the virus can spread all over the world in just six months; according to the exercise of 18event 201, the epidemic caused the suspension of flights, reducing the travel booking rate by 45%; the false information and false information spread on social networks; at the same time, it also caused the global financial crisis, with stock markets plummeting by 20-40% and world GDP shrinking by 11%.
According to toner, when governments and private companies cannot adequately respond to the pandemic, they need to move towards international cooperation and consider how to produce and distribute vaccines at a global level, the report said. He said that cities are becoming more and more crowded, and people are invading the original space of wild animals, which has become the "epidemic era" of diseases. Tona has not completed an in-depth study of Wuhan pneumonia: "we do not know how it spread. The initial impression is that it is significantly milder than SARS, which is reassuring
。 On the other hand, it may be easier to spread than SARS. "
According to toner, who has erred in its refusal to identify "emergencies.".
On Thursday, the who rejected the announcement of Wuhan pneumonia as an "international public health emergency" on the grounds that there were few cases outside China, Mingbao reported. According to Tona, who may have made a mistake. Michael bociurkiw, a global affairs analyst who used to be a who contractor, also wrote on CNN yesterday that the who needs to take rapid action to promote coordination, strengthen surveillance and urge governments to take action by announcing "international public health emergencies".
