Fourteen Portuguese detained in Venezuela, due to the statement by the authorities of the preventive social quarantine for the new coronavirus, will be repatriated on a flight scheduled for Tuesday, advance diplomatic sources to Lusa today.
It is a flight by the airline Plus Ultra, organised by Spain, which will fly from Madrid to Caracas to repatriate European citizens, including Portuguese citizens.
Among the Portuguese to be repatriated is Geronimo Neves, native of Vila do Conde, who travelled to Caracas in March 11th and was scheduled to return to March 15th, the date when Venezuela had already suspended flights and closed the borders.
"We are six people, five family and a friend. We were seized here by a very sad, unfortunate situation,"Geronimo Neves said to Lusa, explaining that one of his children, who was on holiday in Venezuela, died by surprise and had to wait for family members to cremate him.
Geronimo Neves explained that they initially had the flight back to Portugal scheduled for the 15th of March in Iberia via Madrid, but it was cancelled and they had to buy new tickets to Air Europe, which also cancelled the flight.
"We've paid twice for the return, but I don't believe the companies will refund our money. Perhaps they will give us time to make the flight", he said, stressing that Portuguese citizens are not in a position to take on more financial expenses.
Geronimo Neves explained that he is diabetic and hypertensive and that he took medicines only for the four days of the trip, having difficulty getting locally what he needs.
