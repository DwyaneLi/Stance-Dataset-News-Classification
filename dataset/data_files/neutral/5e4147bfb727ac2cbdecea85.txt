A new coronavirus with epicenter in Wuhan, China, has been frightening the world. You've killed over a hundred people and infected thousands of them. How can genetics be used to oversee viruses like this and watch how they spread? In an article published this Wednesday in the mSphere scientific journal of the American Society for Microbiology, a team of scientists describes an improvement in the new generation genetic sequencing to monitor coronavirus, especially those from bats.
Coronavirus are a large family of viruses that live in animals such as birds or bats. They can be transmitted from animals to people, but most of the coronavirus strains only circulate between animals and do not even infect humans. If they reach humans, they can cause respiratory diseases, from a cold to more serious situations such a s severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
To monitor how coronavirus spreads and evolves in animals, new generation sequencing (NGS) has been used. However, this sequenc e can be very expensive and many genetic markers of viruses can be lost.
A team led by Lin-Fa Wang (from Duke University Medical School and Singapore National University) decided to make NGS cheaper and more effective. To this end, it perfected one of the strategies of NGS with molecular probes: DNA or radioactive RNA sequences used to detect the presence of a complementary sequence in a sample.
In the experiments, we were able to identify coronavirus, increase the sensitivity of the process and decrease its cost, as stated in a communication about work. "It does not mean that this improvement is a panacea for all NGS challenges, but in this case it is a step in the right direction," Lin-Fa Wang considers

The investigator adds that this approach will be important to monitor coronavirus in bats. "Coronavirus, especially bats, is an important source of emerging infectious diseases," says Lin-Fa Wang, who has the nickname Batman. For example, the coronavirus that caused the SARS outbreak in 2003 is very close genetically to what is found in bats.
Although it is not yet known the origin of the new coronavirus whose epidemic began in Wuhan, bats are one of the likely sources. These animals may also be a reservoir of the Ebola or Nipah virus. In a scientific article published in 2018 in Cell Host and Microbe magazine, it is suggested that bats will be able to host many viruses due to the evolutionary adaptations they had to make to fly, which ultimately changed their immune system.
And how can the new approach contribute to combating an epidemic? When there are no outbreaks, scientists can update the genetic probing banks related to coronavirus. During outbreaks, this information can be used to monitor the evolution of the virus and its transmission in animals and people.
