At Rome Airport more than 200 passengers have been investigated from a direct flight from the Chinese city of Wuhan to the new Coronavirus. The 202 travellers had been checked in the early morning after arrival in an extra-furnished area away from the normal terminals, said a spokesperson at Fiumicino Airport. No symptoms of the virus were detected in anyone. There are usually three direct flights a week from Wuhan to the Italian capital, which is very popular with Chinese tourists.
