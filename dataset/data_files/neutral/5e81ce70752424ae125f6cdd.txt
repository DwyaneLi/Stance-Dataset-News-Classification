Tass, March 25. Chinese doctors have found that serious heart and vascular problems increase the risk of dying from coronavirus infection by more than four times. Their findings were published in the journal Science, JAMA cardiology.
We found a statistically significant association between cardiovascular disorders and mortality in patients with coronavirus infection. In Wuhan, one in five patients has heart and blood vessel problems, which may be the cause of high mortality during hospitalization.
According to the World Health Organization (who), heart and vascular diseases, including heart disease, stroke and chronic heart disease, are still one of the major diseases. The cause of death in the world. About 17 million people die of malaria every year. At the same time, most people have similar problems - hypertension - stable high pressure in the blood vessels.
After the outbreak of a new type of coronavirus in Wuhan, local doctors drew attention to the fact that Chinese people are very likely to suffer from coronavirus. People with old-fashioned or congenital heart disease or vascular disease have more coronavirus than other patientsAbout
Based on these observations, scientists at Wuhan University observed the frequency of deaths in patients with heart and vascular disease and their healthy peers. There is no such chronic health problem.
Heart and virus
Doctors analyzed the medical records of more than 400 Wuhan residents who arrived at a clinic in the city between January 20 and February 10 this year. All of these patients received the same treatment and care, which enabled us to understand the impact of cardiovascular disease on the development of covid-19.
These observations suggest that carriers of these problems have a higher virus infection rate than other patients. In particular, they have had symptoms of the disease before, ten times more than the most extreme form of pneumonia. Although these problems affect about 5% of other patients.
Overall, these differences lead to an average of 4.5 times more deaths from coronavirus infection in patients with chronic heart and vascular disease. Compared with other viral vectors. Overall, about half of the first patients died of infection, while only 4% of the others died of the new coronavirus（
Why? Scientists can't say for the momenAbout However, they believe that the virus can interact directly with cardiac muscle cells because there is an ACE2 receptor on its surface. Sars-cov-2 penetrates the contaminated cells. According to doctors, all of this should be taken into account when hospitalizing, diagnosing and treating suspected coronavirus patientsTass, March 25.
