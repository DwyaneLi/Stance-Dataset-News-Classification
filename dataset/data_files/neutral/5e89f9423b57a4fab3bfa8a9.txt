Two British Labour Members announced this Friday that they will be isolating themselves in their homes for several days as a precautionary measure, after attending a conference in London in which one of the participants was diagnosed with the Covid-19 coronavirus.
The UK public health system (NHS) contacted around 200 people who participated last day at a congress that gathered bus and transport professionals at Queen Elizabeth II, near the British Parliament.
One participant was identified days later as one of the nine persons infected by the coronavirus in the United Kingdom. While it is unlikely that the degree of contact that conference participants might have with this case is significant, we opted for a prudent approach and informed on the situation,"an NHS spokesman indicated.
Labour colleague Lilian Greenwood, former chairman of the parliamentary transport committee, announced through social networks that she is "completely fine", but chose to be "extremely cautious" and cancelled all public commitments over the next two weeks.
Also, Alex Sobel has indicated that he has been contacted by the health authorities, who have told him that there is a very low risk that he has been infected, but he has chosen to stay home at least until next Thursday.
The coronavirus outbreak (Covid-19) detected in Wuhan has already caused 1.380 deaths, and China has today reported 121 deaths in the last 24-hour period. According to the National Health Committee, the number of infected has grown 5.090 to 63.581.
The balance is higher than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which between 2002 and 2003 caused the death of 774 people around the world, most of whom in China, but the mortality rate remains lowerYeah.
In addition to mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan and the Philippines each reported a dead person and, although thirty countries have diagnosed cases of Covid-19 pneumonia, China responds for around 99% of the infected
