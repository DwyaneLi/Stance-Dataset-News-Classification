The repatriation process of 18 Portuguese and two Brazilian citizens who have been detained for several days in the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the new coronavirus strain, was an authentic odyssey. They are, after all, 20, including two diplomats from the Portuguese embassy in Beijing, and they have all agreed to be in "prophylactic isolation" and no possibility of visits, even controlled, over two weeks at Pulido Valente Hospital and at facilities in Lisbon's Health Park, explained to the health minister at a press conference on Sunday night.
Everyone will have agreed, Marta Temido assured, as Portuguese law does not provide for the compulsory quarantine of non-sick people, unlike in other countries. In addition to 16th Portuguese (and not 17, as originally announced), two Brazilian citizens were transferred from Wuhan "who were also in China and accompanied our compatriots", in addition to the two Portuguese diplomats, specified the ruler, flanked by four secretaries of state (Health, Foreign Affairs, Defence and Civil Protection) and the Director-General for Health.
On the 14-hour flight from Wuhan to France, citizens of three dozen European countries and 20 were stranded on a French military base near Marseilles for showing symptoms of possible contagion. The Portuguese were not in contact with these passengers in the enormous aircraft that carried them, an Airbus A-380, but still, and for a precautionary principle, they will be in this voluntary isolation in the prepared facilities (13 individual rooms in the Valente Pulido and another ten in the Health Park). In Oporto, the Military Hospital is also in place to receive those from the North, but this does not seem necessary for the time beingYeah. "This was the last part of a very long journey", stressed the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Teresa Ribeiro.
Ensuring that there was "calm in the approach to preventive measure" that puts Wuhan repatriates in isolation, Marta Temido stressed that this is a measure "that is in line with what is being done by other countries" and is based on the "epidemic phase" and "containment" decreed at international level. He recalled that the Portuguese were "used to being isolated" in Chinese territory, where they spent several days at home. In this way, he added, they can also have better monitoring by health services". Isolation should last forty days (the incubation period of the disease until the first symptoms appear) and "active surveillance" will be carried out by healthcare professionals twice a day.
At a time when an epidemiological inquiry was still ongoing into those repatriated by an International Sanity Team at Figo Maduro Airport, where they landed on board the C-130 of the Air Force picking them up in Marseille, the Minister explained that if any doubt were raised during this process, This would be clarified by telephone contact from the Health Directorate (DGS) medical helpline. "Your possible medical validation will determine that the case is sent in accordance with the transport protocol to one of the reference hospitals," he said.
New tests
After tests have been carried out on the way out of China, which have proved negative, the 20's are tested again here. At Pulido Valente, there will be harvests of biological material to be analyzed early Monday morning at the National Institute of Health, Doctor Ricardo Jorge (Insa). In a few hours it will be possible to see if any of them are infectedYeah.
Throughout the isolation, if it is suspected that any of them are infected by the revelation of several symptoms, they will be transported immediately to Curry Cabral, a reference hospital for cases confirmed in a possible outbreak of the new coronavirus in Portugal (the others are St. John in Porto, and D. Stephania also in Lisbon and intended for children). In the infectious disease services of these hospitals there are negative pressure rooms (with ventilation systems that do not allow the air to escape), where suspicious cases validated by the DGS are committed until the Insa test results come in. These hospitals only commit suspicious cases validated by DGS and patients.
Urged to explain why a plane with Chinese passengers landed in Ponta Delgada on Saturday after being refused landing in other countries, Health Director Grace Freitas stressed that none of them were coming from Wuhan. He said that the customs authorities contacted the health authorities, that they carried out an epidemiological inquiry and assessed the medical history of passengers. Grace Freitas has ensured that at Portuguese airports what is recommended by international health authorities is being carried out and that "there is no indication to trace on entry".
