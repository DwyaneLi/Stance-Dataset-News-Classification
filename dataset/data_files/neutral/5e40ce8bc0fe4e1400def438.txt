The number of confirmed cases of new lung disease in China has risen to around 220. Another patient died. Three deaths are known, as reported by the health authority of the central Chinese metropolis of Wuhan. That's where the outbreak started. For the first time, infections with the Coronavirus have been detected in several other locations in China. Experts fear that the pathogen likely to be transmitted by an animal may be transmitted from human to human in a different way than initially assumed.
