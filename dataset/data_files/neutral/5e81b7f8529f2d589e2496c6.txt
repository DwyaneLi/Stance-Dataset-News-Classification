Consultant of the director of scientific work of the Central Institute of epidemiology of the Russian Federal Health Supervision Bureau, and expert of the director of Moscow infectious clinical hospital No.2, In an interview with Russian news agency, academician Victor maleyev talked about the situation of Russia's containment of kronaveros, that is, children are often infected by adults to their bodies when they need to see a doctor. Why, despite the spread of covid-19, are private laboratories allowed to test for coronavirus and vaccinate against other infections? Said Lyudmila belonoco.
-Victor vasiliyevich, new cases of coronavirus infection continue to increase in Russia. Most still prevalent diseases or infections begin to spread in the country?
Yes, we see more new things. However, we note that about 90% of cases are imported from other countries, although those who do not comply with the quarantine regulations from abroad also start to spread in Russia. This has happened.
-Unfortunately, it was learned on Wednesday that two patients with positive coronavirus died in Moscow. Why don't you save them?
-Yes, I'm sorry, it's true. These are 88 and 73 year olds with related diseases, including cardiovascular diseaseAbout Therefore, it must be pointed out that the elderly are in danger and it is better to stay at home and not go to public places.
-From March 27, Russia effectively stopped air contact with other countries. Will this help stop the spread of Colorado virus in Russia?
It should be noted that more than 20000 of our citizens plan to return to China, and they will return within 3-5 days. They will only arrive through one point, they will be quarantined immediately, so I hope the infection will not spread seriously, but these people have potential risks, Because they can cause coronavirus infection, we must be very careful and take measures when they come. In general, the suspension of air traffic should certainly help reduce the number of new cases of coronavirus infection.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that he will not work at all next week. Do you think this will help reduce the number of new cases of Colorado virus in one week?
Yes, of course, this is a very correct measure to control the spread of infection. Restrictive measures to isolate people - this is very important now. It's hard to say how long it will take - a week or more, especially, as I said earlier, to know that there are still tourists coming from abroadAbout Therefore, we are taking further measures.
Weekends will help significantly reduce the number of new cases, but they cannot disappear completely. The possibility of infection remains, but growth must be reduced.
-Several private laboratories have begun to offer Russians the chance to pass corona charging tests, even without symptoms. Does it make sense for healthy people to do such tests?
-It provides an opportunity for private laboratories to conduct coronavirus tests so that people have more opportunities to check their health. It's more like a therapeutic self soothing measure, because the decision to do a coronary examination or not should be a doctor rather than the patient themselves, especially if there are no symptoms. Before you go to check for the flu, you are ill. When you go to the doctor, you have symptoms. Therefore, if you feel sick, it's best to see a doctor, who can decide whether you need this diagnosis.
It doesn't make sense to test everyone in any age group. Humans have almost never made any other diagnosis, if not any proper symptoms. This should be the same. In particular, if you check out the Colorado virus, it has to be done every dayAbout For example, a person passed the test but didn't find the Colorado virus, but when he left the lab, he was caught, so the doctor had to determine if a test was needed.
Asymptomatic people, if there is a risk of infidelity, if there is a relative infection, can be tested. Then, even if there is no sign that he needs to be examined. Another option is if a person has a chronic disease, but only the doctor can decide what diagnosis to make.
-Is body temperature 37 a reason to call a doctor and suspect that you have a coronavirus?
Temperature over 37 is a reason to see a doctor. But that doesn't mean a person has a coronavirus infection. You know, there are some pathologists whose body temperature is 37.1, for example, it may be common, and the exact symptoms are not coronavirus. Therefore, it is recommended that doctors look at the whole situation and evaluate all symptoms of patients.
-Can coronavirus infection be completely asymptomatic? How many coronaviruses live in a person's system?
We don't know, even with symptoms. Scientists haven't found out yet. We have seen that even with human release, some people say it may be reinfected, but it may not be a repeat, but a recurrence, that is, the virus is not released from the bodyAbout Therefore, Chinese colleagues have also observed them for a period of time after discharge. We should do the same thing to prevent further infection.
Although we now have a mandatory one-day test before the patient leaves the hospital, because the virus is new, no one knows how it works. There is not much data on this issue.
-Now many people say that children can carry coronavirus. is that true? Can children now be vaccinated against other infectious diseases, or will this weaken the immune system?
-Now there are data that, on the contrary, children are infected by adults, not transmitted infections. You know, if we look at who's coming back from other countries, they're mostly adults, not children, but they have coronavirus in their children.
As for vaccination, on the one hand, it does not hinder the other. Vaccination is possible, but children must be checked before vaccination to ensure that they do not have a fever. Of course, if he is abroad, he should be checked for the presence of coronavirus before being immunized. If the child doesn't go anywhere, not in Moscow, but there are no cases of coronavirus, then vaccination should be carried outAbout
-Sometimes it is suggested that voluntary doctors should be infected with coronavirus to cure their diseases, because they will develop immunity, Then they can work quietly. Is this possible?
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has the same idea. Of course, this is not reasonable, and there is no need to do so. Everyone should protect themselves, wear masks and gloves. We see fatal situations, so it's better to protect ourselves rather than intentionally take risks.
-Is it necessary to carry out Russian quarantine now?
-It should be said that restrictive measures are everywhere. In big cities, it is important to ensure that people do not break the self closed system and deal with it case by case. Monitoring of medical staff and employers is recommended. In some areas, both the police and the police are involved. Verification must be carried out from all aspects.
When can we expect a drop in infection rates in Russia?
We haven't reached the peak yet. There is a risk that those who come back from abroad will cause infection. You can't say it's going to be a recession. We have to watch, we have to monitor that. I don't rule out the increase of new cases in the future, but later it stabilized and began to calm down slowly. Now we can see that even in Italy, the infection rate has decreased. China has lifted some restrictionAbout Infection has certain limitations, cycle. At some stage, it's over, and we hope, in Russia, it'll be over soonConsultant of the director of scientific work of the Central Institute of epidemiology of the Russian Federal Health Supervision Bureau, and expert of the director of Moscow infectious clinical hospital No.2, In an interview with Russian news agency, academician Victor maleyev talked about the situation of Russia's containment of kronaveros, that is, children are often infected by adults to their bodies when they need to see a doctor.
