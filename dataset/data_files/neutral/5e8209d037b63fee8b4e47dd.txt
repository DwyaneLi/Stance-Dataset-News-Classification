With novel coronavirus spreading like wildfire across the globe, social media is rife with world leaders falling sick due to the deadly disease.
But did United States President Donald Trump too fall sick due to the novel coronavirus and is being treated at a hospital for the same?
Facebook user 'DrAbhishek Choudhary' uploaded a video and wrote, "Received one minute ago: Trump just fainted! News flash! US President Donald Trump is being treated for coronavirus in hospital, and Vice-President Mike Pence is taking over. There was panic across the country. Many Americans with Chinese visas are scrambling to get on flights to China at 10 times the usual rate. No official confirmation yet."
India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the video has nothing to do with the novel coronavirus. The video is three years old. In fact, Trump was tested for Covid-19 last week and tested negative.
The number of crows determines the intensity of the lie.
