The AGAP-Portugal Active Association ensures that gyms "are prepared" to deal with the coronavirus epidemic, which has not diminished the search for those spaces and is an additional reason to exercise, which "strengthens immunity".
"We are not currently experiencing any change in the use [of gyms] and the message we want to make very strongly is that this is the wrong time to stop exercising because it improves and strengthens our immune system. The more physical exercise we do, the greater the capacity we have to resist any kind of infection, viral or bacterial,"said the president of the Portuguese Gymnasium Association in statements to Lusa Agency.
According to Jose Carlos Reis, the association drew up and sent all the clubs a contingency plan with the measures to be taken to contain the spread of the virus: "The gyms are prepared. People must, of course, take some care, like not getting their hands in the face, not being too close to others and, essentially, having very large sanitary care. The most important thing is that they wash their hands as often as possible, that is the great measure to be taken,"he said.
Among the measures provided for in the plan sent to gyms are the provision of disinfectants in exercise rooms, the setting in all places of information on the hygiene care to be provided, a "more frequent and systematic" cleaning of objects such as taps, door handles, balconies or handrails, and the definition of a club area to which people with Covid-19 symptoms should be referred.
And while the "situation of some risk of contagion" currently lived justifies that if people are "more alert on a day-to-day basis", Jose Carlos Reis stresses that "leaving exercise is the last thing they should do, because they are hurting themselves"Yeah.
"Exercise benefits the immune system and gyms are prepared. Our advice is that people should continue to practice their physical exercise normally and, if possible, even reinforce it, because their immune system will no doubt be strengthened and have a much superior ability to fight the virus", he reiterated.
