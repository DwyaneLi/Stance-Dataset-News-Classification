The new Coronavirus is spreading with enormous dynamism, despite the countermeasures taken by the Chinese authorities. Throughout the world, researchers try to deduce from the still young development as many characteristics of the organism as possible. What you know and what you don't:
-CORONAVIREN: The pathogen 2019-nCoV is one of the Coronaviruses, so called because they are surrounded by zackenlike structures that resemble a crown. Seven representatives of this group cause respiratory diseases in humans. Three of these are known to cause some serious symptoms: in the case of Sars virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome) also originating in China, 2002/2003 became known around 8000 cases, around 800 people died. ==References====External links====External links==* Official website It is less contagious, but more aggressive: from around 2500 infected to November 2019, nearly 860- about every third died. 2019-nCoV is very closely related to Sars.
INFECTIOSITY: It is difficult to assess how infectious the new virus is. The Chinese authorities assume that an infected person infects on average 1,4 to 2,5 people, which would be similar to Sars. "Such figures are extremely unreliable," says the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite. Consequently, the rate of transmission depends on many factors, such as whether people are socially active or stay at home. That is what the measures in China are aimed at. "I think these measures are doing something." It is positive that people usually only become infectious with the symptom, unlike the flu, where people are already infectious before they get sick.
-AGGRESSIVITY: The new Coronavirus appears to be less aggressive than Sars and Mers. By Monday, 80-year-olds of around 2800-year-old infected died, corresponding to a 2,9-percent mortality rate.
Yeah. However, the number is likely to be misleading, because it is precisely at the beginning of an outbreak that the serious cases become known. Three percent mortality would be very much, in Drostens'opinion. The expert assumes that the ten percent given for sars is also a much too high value. "There was probably much more than the well-known 8000 Sars cases," he explains.
-SYMPTOME: The incubation period between infection and onset of symptoms is two to 14 days. The lung disease is manifested by fever, dry cough, fatigue and shortness of breath. Because the virus infects the lower respiratory tract, sufferers have no flu. Eventually, the symptoms resemble a Sars infection. No wonder, because the new virus docks at the same receptor. The test on the virus is usually based on sputum (ejection) analysis and lasts about two hours.
There is no special treatment for lung disease. Severely ill patients are treated symptomatically: with fever-reducing agents, the treatment of possible additional bacterial infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation.
-IMPFUNG: Vaccination would be the best way to contain the epidemic. According to Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the Bernhard Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine, vaccine candidates are currently being tested against Mers in humans. Provided they are successful, they will be available at the earliest in a few months. "This could then be built on," says Schmidt-Chanasit.
-RESERVOIRE: The reservoirs of various coronavirus are located in the animal kingdom. With Mers, camels are the origin, with Sars and the new pathogen, the reservoirs are probably with bats. The Sars pathogen probably jumped on humans from kittens offered on Chinese markets. Also 2019-nCoV is probably based on an animal market in China. The species of animal from which the virus jumped is currently unknown
Yeah.
For protection against this virus as well as other viruses, experts recommend common hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectants and distance to the sick. Schmidt-Chanasit and Drosten consider the usefulness of normal breathing masks, as seen everywhere on the streets today in China, to be rather low.
PROGNOSEN: Some experts expect a long outbreak. "We should regard this as a marathon and not a sprint," said Chris Whitty, who advises the British Government on health issues. "The extent and impact of this outbreak is currently unclear because the situation is developing rapidly," wrote a team about Anthony Fauci from the US National Health Institutes (NIH) in the specialist journal "JAMA". The virologist Drosten, on the other hand, can imagine that the epidemic ends just as quickly as the Sars outbreak, which was quickly flayed and 2004 was declared to have ended. "I am inclined to think optimistically, because this is a Sars-like disease." It is also true that there has so far been little spread outside China. "This is extremely encouraging." Sars continues to train, but only in the animal kingdom. (dpa) +++ This article was published on 27. January at 17.58 o'clock updated +++
