The World Health Organisation (WHO) decided this Wednesday to extend until Thursday morning the meeting of the Emergency Committee to decide whether to declare an international public health emergency the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China.
The WHO Emergency Committee, made up of experts from various countries, including Chinese epidemiologists, was meeting today at the headquarters of the organisation in Geneva, Switzerland, without reaching a consensus, and therefore decided to meet again on Thursday, indicated the chairman of the expert body, Didier Houssin, cited by the Spanish news agency Efe.
The international public health emergency presupposes the adoption of preventive measures at world level and has been declared for the epidemics of H1N1 influenza in 2009 of the Zika virus in 2016, Ebola, which struck part of West Africa, from 2014 to 2016, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, from 2018, and polio in 2014.
The new coronavirus (virus family), which causes viral pneumonias, was detected in China in December and has already infected more than 400 people and caused death to at least 17.
The virus in question is transmitted between animals and passed on to humans, and there are already records of individual transmission to person, but still under not fully substantiated circumstances.
The first cases of the coronavirus "2019 --nCoV" appeared in the Chinese town of Whuan when people with viral pneumonia (lung infection caused by a virus) began to arrive at hospitals.
It was found that all people were often working or visiting Huanan's seafood and meat market in the same city.
The exact origin of the infection is still unknown, but it would have been contaminated animals, which are marketed alive, to transmit it to humans.
Symptoms of this coronavirus ar e more intense than flu and include fever, pain, general malaise and respiratory distress, including shortness of breath
Yeah.
In addition to China, with the largest number of infections, several other Asian countries, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, and the United States have already reported cases.
