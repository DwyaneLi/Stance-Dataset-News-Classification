Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Mexico's president, confirmed Wednesday during his daily press conference that health authorities are studying a possible case of the Wuhan virus and coronavirus in the state of Tamaulipas, in northwestern Mexico. "He is under observation," he said the president told reporters. Secretary of Health of the State, Gloria Molina, said that the possible carrier of the virus is a physician and university professor of Chinese origin residing in the city of Reynosa, on the border with the United States. According to Molina, the man is 57 years old and traveled to the Asian country on 25 December, returning to Mexico on January 10. The journey that was made from Reynosa, where he lives, to Mexico City, and after a stopover in Tijuana, arrived in Beijing. That same day moved to the central city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.
The return of the man from Wuhan to Reynosa involved the same route. "Under strict biosafety protocol, the Government of Tamaulipas visited, took samples and initiated the investigation of a male patient with respiratory disease," said the Health Ministry in a statement issued Wednesday morning. Lopez Obrador's executive on Tuesday had issued notice possible cases of respiratory infection associated with the virus originated in Asia and throughout the morning on Wednesday confirmed that a patient was under observation. Mexican President has asked the population to be aware of all the alerts issued by the Health sector.
Hugo Lopez Gatell, undersecretary of Prevention and Health Promotion, has also announced that the government is taking preventive measures to control international flights from the Asian country. The official has assured that special attention will be at airports in Monterrey, Cancun and Guadalajara, where they arrive direct from China. In addition a protocol warning will be issued both in hospitals and airfields to detect symptoms such as fever or respiratory distress. The US border is another point of special care because, according to Lopez Gatell, there is a huge Asian community, especially in California. Mexico has a National Reference Laboratory for dealing with such cases since the last influenza pandemic that hit the country ten years ago.
The virus killed Wednesday amounted to 17 and are confirmed 441 cases, mostly in the city of Wuhan, as stated by the Chinese government. Until Tuesday five countries had notified the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed several cases; two in Thailand, one in Japan, one in Korea and one in South America.Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Mexico's president, confirmed Wednesday during his daily press conference that health authorities are studying a possible case of the Wuhan virus and coronavirus in the state of Tamaulipas, in northwestern Mexico.
