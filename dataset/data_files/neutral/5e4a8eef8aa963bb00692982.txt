India is flying an aircraft to China's Wuhan later this week with medical supplies and will be bringing back Indians trapped in the coronavirus-hit Chinese province. The government has asked Indian nationals seeking evacuation from China to contact the embassy in Beijing.
The Indian embassy in Beijing has said, "GoI will send a consignment of medical supplies on a relief flight to Wuhan later this week to support China to fight the COVID-19 epidemic. On its return, the flight will have limited capacity to take on board Indians wishing to return to India from Wuhan/Hubei."
Indians who wish to be evacuated from China's Wuhan has been asked to contact on the hotline numbers +8618610952903 and +8618612083629 or via email on helpdesk.beijing@mea.gov.in. However, they will have to contact the embassy before 7 pm (IST) on Monday.
India has so far evacuated over 600 people from Wuhan where the coronavirus outbreak has already killed over 1700 people and around 66,000 people have been infected by the virus.
A total of 650 people were brought back from Wuhan in China on February 1 and 2 in two 747 Boeing Air India aircraft after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China. While 406 of these are being looked after at the ITBP facility, rest are at an Army centre at Manesar in Haryana.
All 406 people at the ITBP facility have tested negative for novel coronavirus in the latest sample examination and will be discharged in a phased manner beginning Monday.
India has so far reported three confirmed cases of the virus, all in Kerala.
One of the three medical students, who had tested positive for novel coronavirus infection and were treated at a hospital in Kerala, has been discharged after recovery.
Kerala has also released the student who tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the state after two consecutive test results returned negative.
India has kept around 15,991 people across the country on community surveillance.
