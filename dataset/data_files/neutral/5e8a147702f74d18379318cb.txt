The Spanish Government wanted to start testing the broad strata of the population with rapid coronavirus tests. However, several laboratories of microbology in large hospitals explain that these tests do not work well.
According to the newspaper El Pais, which cites a source who participated in the tests, the preliminary results of the analyses carried out with the newly arrived kits from China did not go as planned.

Rapid coronavirus tests bought by Spain and China do not work well
Rapid testing, manufactured by the Chinese company Bioeasy, based in Shenzhen, is 30% sensitive when it should be more than 80%, indicates these sources.
Experts concluded that it would be best to continue using the current test based on a molecular technique called PCR (polymerase chain reaction).
However, the Chinese Embassy in Spain has ensured that the rapid test kits purchased by Spain to diagnose Covid-19 cases were bought from an unlicensed company.Yeah.
The Chinese Ministry of Trade offered the Spanish Ministry of Health "a list of recommendations from classified suppliers". Bioeasy does not appear on the same list, according to information left in the embassy's official account on the social network Twitter.
The embassy further states that the company does not yet have an "official licence from the National Administration of Medical Products of China to sell its products".
I respect the information published recently by some Spanish measurements on the rapid tests of 35;COVID2019 purchased by 35;Espana to \35;China, we have informed you of this.

Rapid tests work in a similar way to pregnancy tests: the sample is taken from the area of the nose zone, diluted and deposited in a cartridge with a test strip that marks the lines and indicates whether it is positive, negative or invalid. Tests detect the presence of antigen and the result is obtained in 10 or 15 minutes.
The Spanish government has acquired 340.000 examinations and intended to test health workers and elderly people admitted to residences and then extend it to another population. The areas of Galicia, Andalusia and Madrid are running rapid tests, in which a sample is taken from the patient without him getting out of the car.
These tests purchased from China served as triage, i.e. when detecting a positive, the patient can already be diagnosed and treated appropriately. If the Chinese test was of sufficient quality, only negative or doubtful results would require a subsequent PCR to confirm, refers to the same publication from the indicated sources.
In other words, due to the low sensitivity of the purchased material from Bioeasy, it is not possible to make a large selection and test part of the population, since it is always necessary to do PCR work, i.e. in many cases patients would have to be tested again in laboratoryYeah.
The Spanish Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC) has issued a statement to which El Pais had access, informing Spanish health authorities that it is not recommended to use these rapid tests, but to continue with PCR tests.
The SEIMC document ensures that a "rapid diagnosis of these cases at hospital level is relevant to identify, isolate and treat patients quickly" and facilitate "emergency decongement". "For this we need rapid tests with high sensitivity", it adds.
The Ministry of Health also confirmed to the Spanish publication the poor results of the sensitivity and specificity analyses. The manufacturer was subsequently given an order to replace the tests and to have them, when obtained by the Spanish government, approved for use in Europe.
The Carlos III Institute of Health published a video on his Twitter account explaining how these tests work.

Spain is following the recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) by extending the tests to Covid-19 to more sections of the population. In statements to El Pais, the Emergency Coordinator of the Ministry of Health, Fernando Simon, reported that there are about nine thousand faulty tests, validated at the Carlos III Health Institute and hospitals in the Madrid Community. The health authorities found that the data included in the quality certificates "CE-marked" were not true, which led to the return of the lots, they explained.
