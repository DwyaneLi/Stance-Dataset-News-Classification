The number of confirmed coronavirus cases remained below the 700 mark in India on Thursday. By March 26, coronavirus had infected 694 people in India and killed 16. The country of 1.25 billion people has been under a lockdown since Wednesday where people have been confined to their homes and public transport has come to a halt.
On Thursday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a $22.6 billion economic stimulus package to help the economy overcome the loss the Covid-19 has caused.
On its first day of lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India had a total of 649 confirmed coronavirus cases and 13 deaths. But what was the situation in the countries which have the highest coronavirus cases when they reached this number?
The India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) took the top 10 countries infected by the coronavirus and mapped the number of deaths they had witnessed when they were close to 650 cases (or when India started its three-week-long lockdown).
Of the top infected countries, Iran had the most number of fatalities when it reached a figure close to 600. On February 29, the novel coronavirus had infected 593 people and killed 43 in Iran.
In the United States of America, which has the third-highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, the infection had killed 26 people when the number of confirmed cases reached 583.
China, which has the highest number of Covid-19 cases, had recorded 17 deaths when the number of cases reached 584 in the country on January 23, the same day China locked down the entire city of Wuhan, capital of the Hubei province where the pandemic had originated.
Similarly, Italy had reported 17 deaths when it reached 665, Spain had 17 deaths when it reached 589.
However, countries like France (9), United Kingdom (8), South Korea (5) had fewer fatalities than India when their confirmed cases hovered around 600.
Currently, there is no vaccination to Covid-19 and social distancing is sought to be the only option to control the pandemic.
Interestingly, India locked down 1.2 billion people when it had close to 600 cases. Italy locked down the entire country when the number of cases crossed 9,000. Many countries with high infection rates are still mulling over a complete lockdown.
