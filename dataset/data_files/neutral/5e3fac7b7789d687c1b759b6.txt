Moscow, January 22. / Cole. Taschristine marchenko/ The new type of coronavirus 2019 ncov, which causes unknown pneumonia in China, cannot be described as particularly dangerous at present because of its low average mortality. Herman shiplin, a virologist and deputy director of the strategic planning center of the Russian Ministry of health, expressed this view.
"I have such doubts that the virus will definitely lead to a higher mortality rate, but it still does not reach the level of special pathogen, that is to say, it is called a particularly dangerous virus." "Now, the tongue doesn't move," he said.
According to shiplin, the outbreak of new coronary aneurysms in Russia can be compared with the events in 2002-2003, when severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out in China, As an atypical pneumonia, by Colorado SARS. At that time, there were more than 8400 cases, of which more than 800 died. According to experts, at that time, the death rate of SARS was about 10%, and the death rate of 2019-ncv in new Colorado was several times lower.
"Obviously, the virus is not that positive," shiplin said. -Under the SARS system, the mortality rate of the elderly and patients with serious health problems is very high
About This is a repetitive situation, but here, for some reason, the average mortality rate is much lower. [this may be related to] unreliable incidence statistics, or the virus may be less pathogenic than SARS.
Saplin pointed out that ganavirusa is not a new phenomenon, but due to its complications, special attention should be paid. Coronavirus has serious consequences. The most serious is called mers Middle East syndrome virus. He's 35% lethal, "he added.
Russian import and diffusion rate
According to shiplin, the spread of the virus around the world, including in Russia, is highly likely. This is mainly because China is the most populous country in the world. Chinese people are very mobile. They travel around the world. Now they spend the new year there. They visit each other. They fly to other countries and visit their relatives. If someone from those flying to Russia is infected, then someone will be infected. So the risk is very high, "experts say.
However, it is not clear how fast the virus is spreading among people. " We have an indicator of how many people a person can infect. Specifically, this indicator has not yet calculated the specific situation of the virus.
About For example, in SARS, one person was found to have infected 80 people, which is the highest number. " He also explained that the indicator depends on many factors, including the stability of the external environment and the virulence of the virus - its ability to infect humans.
The Russian consumer protection agency has taken all necessary measures to minimize the possibility of new Colorado virus entering Russian territory and being contaminated by Russians. In particular, according to the Tass news service, passengers were checked at the airport with a thermograph. In addition, the railway station was inspected.
Testing systems and vaccines
Earlier, Sergei Krakow, Deputy Minister of health of Russia, told TASS, The Ministry of health has begun to develop a coronavirus vaccine, and is negotiating with Chinese scientists on the possibility of producing biomaterials, Start direct production of vaccines. Shiplin points out that this kind of work usually takes about half a year. According to him, the most important thing now is to master virus detection methods nationwide. However, because experts do not have biomaterials, their development becomes more complicated.
"The method must be converted to a virus detection package. Because we don't even have patients.
About In order to show what work is, it has to be clinical material and we don't have it. Experts explain that when its clinical effect is proven to be design. At the same time, he added, it may be an option for Russian experts to visit China.
