A plane arrived from Beijing this Saturday in Lisbon. It is expected to happen when a few minutes are past 7am. The JD 429 of Beijing Capital is the only direct air link between national and Chinese territory, albeit with a technical stop in the middle. Passengers will disembark and what they will find at Humberto Delgado Airport is information about the coronavirus posted in the Arrival Area. No one's gonna be traced, this is done in origin. "At the moment, no one better than China makes this detection," said this Friday afternoon the Director General of Health, Grace Freitas.
The Express questioned ANA Aeroports and the airline Beijing Capital to find out whether any additional security measures were envisaged or whether the possibility of this connection being suspended. Could not get any answer. On the Express, ANA only mentioned that "it is monitoring the situation", following "the guidelines and recommendations received by this entity that are implemented immediately".
As of now, there's no record of any coronavirus cases in Portugal. There's a suspect, confirmed Health Directorate to Lusa. This is a 45-year-old Felgueiras businessman who recently returned from a business trip to China, plus RTP. He has symptoms of respiratory infection and is confined to St. John's hospital, where blood tests have been performed and are waiting for the results, which are being examined by the Ricardo Jorge Institute.
"This patient has returned from China on the 22nd day of January where he had contact with a citizen likely to be infected by 2019-nCoV [coronavirus] and is being sent to the St. John's University Hospital in Porto, a reference hospital for these situations", said the DGS in a statement cited by Lusa
Yeah.
During the afternoon of this Friday, the possibility of a suspicion was also reported at Cascais Hospital, which was denied the Express by that healthcare unit.
As for the 17 Portuguese that the state is picking up Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, there is still no forecast for the arrival in Portugal. The delay in authorising the Chinese authorities to leave the country delayed their return.
When they land, the Director General of Health explained, they will be "carefully" evaluated. Grace Freitas also admitted that the Portuguese may be subject to "voluntary quarantine". "It may be at home or in facilities that the Ministry of Health will make available but we are not absolutely sure if it will be the modality for special citizens who have been confined more than half days in the city where the epidemic appeared," he said. "It doesn't mean they stay in, for logistical reasons they can take up facilities in hospitals."
However, Spain confirmed the first case. According to the health authorities cited by El Pais, the case took place on the island La Gomera, which is part of the Canary Islands. He was one of five people under observation after being in contact with a patient infected with the virus in Germany. Sweden also recorded the first case this Friday.
The number of fatalities has increased again: it's 258, all in China. That's close to 11 thousand people infected with the virus.
