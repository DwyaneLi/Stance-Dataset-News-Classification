According to AFP today, the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan continued, and Chinese people made road barriers to prevent virus invasion.
The report said the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan continued, and people from all over China made simple roadblocks, such as stacking bicycles to block community entrances, to prevent the invasion of deadly viruses. Another photo shows a man waving a martial arts knife, calling for "no entry for outsiders.".
The Chinese government has taken drastic measures, including strict traffic restrictions, to prevent the 2019 new coronavirus (Wuhan pneumonia) epidemic. At present, more than 50 million people are trapped in Wuhan and surrounding cities.
The report said that more than one confirmed case was added every day in China, causing panic among the whole people. The general public and local officials were worried that tourists from Hubei Province would bring the virus into their communities, so they decided to make simple roadblocks to help prevent the spread of the epidemic.
Outside a residential area in Beijing, people made barricades of public bicycles and wooden stairs to block the entrance of side doors, forcing visitors to register with the guards before entering. There are also various self-made roadblocks in other parts of China, and relevant photos are wildly spread on microblogs. One photo shows a man wearing a medical mask sitting on a simple barricade, wielding a traditional martial arts knife. In front of the barricade there is a sign that says "no admittance".
Another photo allegedly taken in Shandong Province shows two elderly people wearing medical masks standing behind a cardboard sign. There are instructions on the sign asking visitors to turn back and not enter the community.
However, the authorities today ordered the removal of all unauthorized roadblocks, which are alleged to be impeding the transport of agricultural products, AFP said.
