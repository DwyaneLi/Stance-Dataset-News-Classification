The director of the Cape Verde Epidemic Surveillance and Response Service said this Tuesday that the country intends to rely on Portugal's support to withdraw its students from Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in China.
"We have 13 students in Wuhan province, we are monitoring the situation and there is a chance that these students will return to Cape Verde as the situation develops. But we're already figuring that out. We are already making plans to organize their return, we already have information that comes out, will go out with the Portuguese", said Domingos Teixeira.
The person responsible spoke on the day a rapid intervention technical team was set up, which held its first meeting in the city of Praia, to coordinate the implementation of internal preventive measures, early detection of suspected cases of coronavirus.
The Director of the Epidemic Surveillance and Response Service has revealed that this was the most urgent step out of the meeting of the Rapid Response Team, which will now prepare a recommendation and guidance on how to withdraw students from China.
"It is being worked out by the team, we already know the number of students, we already have an idea more or less how they will come", continued Domingos Teixeira.
Cape Verde has 350 students in China who do not report any suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus, including those in isolation in the city of Wuhan.
On Monday, the Portuguese Government expressed its intention to remove by air the about 20 Portuguese detained in Wuhan, a Chinese city where the coronavirus outbreak originated which has already killed over a hundred people in the country and has since been placed under quarantine
Yeah.
In a statement addressed to the Portuguese residing in the city, the Embassy of Portugal clarifies that it began "immediately all steps" to proceed to the evacuation by air, using a chartered civilian aircraft to "pick up Wuhan" and from there take them "directly to Portugal".
The Rapid Reaction Technical Team in Cape Verde is multi-sectoral and includes the ministry and health stations, police, airports, customs, among other entities, explained the Director of Services.
According to Domingos Teixeira, the Cape Verdean authorities already have a contingency plan, which will include actions at the entrance of the country (ports and airports), in health structures, in communities and healthcare professionals.
The person responsible has advanced that the country does not yet have recommendations from the World Health Organisation (WHO) to restrict the movement of people, but that the country's entry points will be controlled to reduce risks.
Domingos Teixeira also stressed the importance of prevention and protection in case of any symptoms.
China raised to 106 dead and more than four.000 infected the balance of the new coronavirus detected at the end of the year in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province (center).
