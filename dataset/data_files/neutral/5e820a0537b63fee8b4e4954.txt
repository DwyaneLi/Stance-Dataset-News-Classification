The growing scare over Coronavirus has taken the colour off Holi this year in the National Capital. Families across Delhi are cutting down on celebrations and have cancelled pool parties. There is hardly any demand for Chinese colours and pichkaris in Delhi-NCR. Shops in the capital are deserted. Instead of buying colours, water guns and balloons, the demand for hand sanitizers and masks is on the rise.
Mask and sanitizer clad Holi awaits this time. Before colours and pichkaris, I bought masks and sanitisers to maintain cleanliness, sanitation and hygiene. We had a hard time convincing our kids to use these instead of colours. Finally, the kids have now understood the seriousness of the situation, said Rajendra, a resident of Dwarka.
Traders said that the spread of the virus has led to decrease in the demand for Chinese Holi related goods. In Sarojini Nagar market, the sellers of water guns and balloons complained that because of the fear of Coronavirus, people aren't even willing to buy products which are made in India. I kept aside all products which came to me last year from China. This time everything at my shop is Made in India’ but because of the fear of the spread of coronavirus, my sale has come down by 80 percent, said Mukesh, a trader in Babu Market.
Jeetu, a resident of Dwarka, said they are avoiding large gatherings this year. This time, we are witnessing multi dimensional effects of coronavirus. It has not just affected our trade but we're constantly worried about our family. To start with, we're boycotting all social gatherings and will be celebrating only with our closed family members.
Nagendra, another resident of Dwarka, said this year Holi will be celebrated over social media. I think it's going to be the social media Holi this year where we'll greet everyone on social media platforms to adhere to the advisories being circulated by the government. I've instructed my wife and children to stay indoors and enjoy Holi with herbal gulaal and good movies.
Trader Sanjeev too said he will be avoiding close contact with people this Holi. Somewhere, we all know that the threat is still there. However, convincing the same to children is really difficult but our RWA is ensuring minimum outsiders and maximum fun. We'll greet everyone, exchange colours and that'll be it. Avoiding uncovered and manufactured food is extremely important, so we're not going to exchange sweets and chocolates this time. This way, the children will stay safe as well.
