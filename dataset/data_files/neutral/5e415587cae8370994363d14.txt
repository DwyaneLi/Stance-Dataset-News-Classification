Many countries are not prepared to face the outbreak of the new coronavirus that began in December in China and has already spread to 15 countries, this Thursday alerted an international body monitoring global health crises.
In a statement, the Global Preparatedness Monitoring Board (GPMB), an independent body launched in 2018 by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the World Bank, highlighted the "responsiveness" being provided by many countries and the WHO, as well as the "transparency of China in the exchange of information".
However, the organisation expressed its concern that many countries are not yet ready to deal with the threat, and therefore called on the leaders of all countries to "take immediate action to ensure they have the necessary capabilities".
"All local countries and governments, including those that have not been affected, must urgently devote resources to strengthening their essential preparedness capabilities," stated the GPMB, adding that measures must be taken to "prevent, detect, inform and respond" the outbreak.
The alert of this control organisation takes place on the day the WHO meets for the second time in a week to decide whether the new coronavirus outbreak constitutes a "public health emergency of international interest".
The coronavirus, detected at the end of the year in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province (centre), has already caused the death of at least 170 people in China and has infected more than seven.700 others.
In addition to mainland China, cases of infection have been reported in Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the United States of America, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, Australia, Canada, Germany, France (the first European country to detect cases), Finland, India, the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates.
