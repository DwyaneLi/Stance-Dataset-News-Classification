Italian businessman en route to St John's Hospital in Porto due to suspected coronavirus
The CM knows the man has respiratory distress and fever. Around 90 factory workers on Felgueiras, where the man was working, were forced to be temporarily quarantined. Later they were ordered to leave but were warned by the fire department to keep an eye out for possible symptoms.
Another suspected case of coronavirus allegedly detected at Cascais Hospital was denied to the CM by official source of the DGS.
Yeah.
The World Health Organisation, remember, declared on Thursday an international public health emergency as a result of the outbreak of the new coronavirus in China.
