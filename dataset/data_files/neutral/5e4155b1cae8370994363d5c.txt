Brazilian citizens living in China released an emotional video on YouTube this Sunday calling once again on President Jair Bolsonaro to remove them from that country in the East, where there is a coronavirus epidemic, and to take them to a safe place, as they have already done with their national governments of several countries.
The video is yet another desperate attempt by Brazilians living in China to raise awareness of the president of their country, who has already denied similar requests and has shown clear opposition to rescuing immigrants.
In the video released this Sunday, several Brazilians who are in Chinese territory for the most diverse reasons take part in the reading of excerpts from an open letter addressed to Bolsonaro, noting that, although they went to study or work in China in search of opportunities that were not in Brazil, they are still Brazilians. Many of these Brazilians are still in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the disease was discovered, others are in other cities of Hubei province and spread throughout various regions of China.
According to the video, no Brazilian in that Asian country has so far shown symptoms or even any suspicion, no matter how slight, of having the coronavirus, dropping one of the allegations in order to refuse to rescue them, that to help a few dozen people, it would put millions at risk of others. Participants in the message also claim that they agree to quarantine in any other country outside China and Brazil, disarming another excuse for Bolsonaro, that Brazil does not have a specific law to quarantine people.
Friday, after being criticized for not saying anything about the world crisis of the coronavirus and the calls of the Brazilians, Bolsonaro called the press
Yeah. In a series of hectic arguments, he stated that he could not send a plane to China without first the Supreme Court and Congress authorizing this expense, which was estimated at approximately 500 thousand dollars, so that it would not be used to try and take him out of office by accusing him of misuse of public money.
