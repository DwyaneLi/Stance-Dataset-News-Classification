The electoral process of FC Porto, originally planned for April 18th, will be postponed without a date yet defined, informed Lusa Matos Fernandes, president of the club's General Assembly (AG).
The day after the President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, declared a state of emergency in Portugal due to the spread of Covid-19, Jose Matos Fernandes informed the members of the Portuguese club of the suspension of the elections.
"I have taken the decision to suspend the elections and only reschedule when we come out of this situation," said the AG president.
The delivery of the lists would end this Thursday, but due to the state of emergency, this last day will also be suspended and will be completed on the first working day after the end of the state now declared.
"It would not be fair for the deadline for the submission of the lists not to be met in full. The remaining day will therefore be the first working day after the end of the state of emergency,"he said.
So far, two candidate lists have been given for the elections of FC Porto, for the 2020-24 quad, one led by the current president, Pinto da Costa, and another led by Jose Fernando Rio.
