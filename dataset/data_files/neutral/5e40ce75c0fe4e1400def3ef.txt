"This is unique in recent history," said Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM). According to one speaker, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is also not aware of a comparable case.
On Thursday afternoon, it was also announced that similar restrictions would apply to two more million cities. Together with the residents of the already closed-off Wuhan metropolis, the restrictions apply to nearly twenty million people.
The Chinese government has practically sealed off the city of Wuhan, which is particularly affected by the new Coronavirus: flights, trains, ferries, long-distance buses and public transport have been stopped, and the roads that went out of business on Thursday have been gradually blocked. In addition, protective masks should be worn in public. Those who do not wear masks in hotels, restaurants, shopping centers or parks will be punished, the newspaper China Daily reported.
Schmidt-Chanasit said that such a measure could probably only be implemented in China in this form. The decision to close the city was taken without consultation with the WHO, according to the UN Special Organisation based in Geneva. The action is to be welcomed, said WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Mass collections are a risk factor for dissemination. He envisioned clearer travel instructions at the end of the emergency committee's deliberations on Thursday evening. (dpa)
