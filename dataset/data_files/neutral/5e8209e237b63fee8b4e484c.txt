Donald Trump recently took to Twitter to announce that the United States will powerfully support the industries that are majorly hit by the novel coronavirus outbreak. However, in his tweet, he referred to the novel coronavirus as the 'Chinese Virus.'
"The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before," he wrote in the tweet.

The fact that Donald Trump called the novel coronavirus 'Chinese Virus' did not go down well with the Twitterati.
Netizens were quick to school the US President. Soon after he posted the tweet, they flooded it with angry comments and called him a racist. "Chinese virus? You are indeed a racist, proved time and again," a comment read. "Its called the Coronavirus," read another comment.
Here are some more reactions:
