The Airbus A320 plant in Tianjin near Beijing was closed indefinitely due to the health crisis caused by the coronavirus, today announced the European aeronautical group.
"The country and international travel restrictions pose logistical challenges. The Tianjin final assembly site is currently closed", said an Airbus spokesman.
Tianjin facilities "were already closed for Chinese New Year celebrations and reopening was delayed" due to the spread of the coronavirus, said the spokesman.
"Airbus is closely monitoring the development of the coronavirus situation and is implementing the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO)", according to the European aircraft manufacturer, which claims to be affected "globally".
"Airbus China is following the Chinese Government's requests by teleworking, which the group is facilitating with computer equipment, s o that officials from all sites, including Tianjin, do not need to travel", reads the statement.
In addition to Tianjin's final assembly line, Airbus has two others in Toulouse for the construction of A320 (A319, A320 and A321) airplanes and will install a third in 2021.
The group also has final assembly lines of this A320 family in northern Germany, Hamburg (four), and in the southern United States, Mobile (one).
The production capacity of the Tianjin plant should reach six aircraft per month at the end of 2019, according to Airbus.
The factory is also expected to produce interior accessories and become a delivery center for A350 widbody customers in 2021.
Airbus delivered 863 aircraft to 2019, the largest number in history, including 642 of the A320 family.
