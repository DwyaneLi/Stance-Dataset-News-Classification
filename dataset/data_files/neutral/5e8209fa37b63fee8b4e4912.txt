This is epic...
Two days ago, a video of Union Minister Ramdas Athawale chanting, "Go corona, go corona", along with Chinese Consul General in Mumbai Tang Guocai and Buddhist monks at a prayer meet went viral on social media.
Coronavirus was first reported from China's Wuhan city in December 2019 and eventually turned into an outbreak. It has affected over 100 countries so far, with the total number of cases crossing one lakh globally. In India, confirmed coronavirus cases increased to 60 on Wednesday, including 16 Italian tourists.
The World Health Organisation (WHO), meanwhile, has declared coronavirus as a pandemic.
