The British authorities announced this Wednesday that they will send medical teams to meet passengers arriving from Wuhan, a city in central China where the new coronavirus was detected, while Italy will control passenger temperatures.
As of Thursday, the Italian Ministry of Health has planned the establishment of a "health channel with temperature control through a scanner" at Fiumicino airport (Rome), which performs three direct weekly flights with connection to Wuhan.
"It is also planned to compile a form indicating the destinations and paths of passengers, after landing", explained the ministry in the communique.
Other countries introduced systematic temperature controls for travellers from China, including Russia (via airliners) and Thailand.
In London, the three weekly rights flights between Wuhan and Heathrow Airport were subject to "enhanced surveillance" as of today, the British Ministry of Health said, considering "low" the risk to the population of the United Kingdom.
According to the same source, medical teams will receive passengers on these flights "to provide advice and help those who feel bad".
The ministry, which describes these measures as "proportionate and preventive", adds that they can be extended to flights from other Chinese cities "if necessary".
The level of risk to the British population has increased from "very low" to "low" due to the possible arrival in the country of people with the virus.
The virus, which was initially detected last December in Wuhan, a city in central China, spread to several Asian countries and reached the United States, where the first case was identified.
Yeah.
On Tuesday, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control considered that the risk of importing cases to the European Union was "moderate", but on the occasion of the Chinese New Year it may "increase" due to an increase in travel.
The Romanian authorities have also indicated that they intend to establish temperature controls for passengers at airports.
In France, Health Minister Agn o s Buzyn considered the risk of "low" but "not excluded" introduction on Tuesday.
Temperature controls have not been implemented, however precautionary messages are transmitted on direct flights to and from Wuhan and posters reminding the procedures to be followed in case of symptoms are displayed at international airports, Buzyn explained.
In Germany, there are no'specific measures at this stage at airports', according to the Federal Ministry of Health.
In Portugal, the Government has today alerted the Portuguese to travel to China and surrounding areas to report on the development of a new virus and has recommended that tourists and residents register or register with the consulate.
The number of cases of the new coronavirus has increased rapidly and today 444 confirmed cases, with 17 dead, according to the Deputy Director of the National Health Commission of China.
Nine people died, all in Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan.
Outside China, cases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in South Korea, the United States, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan and today in Macao.
Cases feed fears about a potential epidemic, similar to atypical pneumonia, or Severe Acute Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which between 2002 and 2003 killed 650 people in mainland China and Hong Kong.
