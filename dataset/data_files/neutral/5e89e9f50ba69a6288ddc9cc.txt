This Thursday, the Chinese health authorities reported 34 new cases, but all in people who have returned to China in recent days.
According to China Daily, the Chinese government admits to lifting the blockade of Wuhan after 14 consecutive days without any new local transmission.
34 cases recorded in recent hours have raised to 189 the number of people diagnosed with covid-19 after returning to the country.

By Wednesday, China reported eight thousand cases. Overall, there are records of 3245 deaths and 7263 people are sick.
