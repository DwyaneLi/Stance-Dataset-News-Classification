India could face between around 100,000 and 1.3 million confirmed cases of the disease caused by the new coronavirus by mid-May if it continues to spread at its current pace, according to a team of scientists based mainly in the United States.
The estimates reinforce concerns among some medical officials and experts in India that the country of 1.4 billion people could see coronavirus cases jump sharply in the coming weeks and put its health system under severe strain.
The scientists said projections could change as the country conducts more testing, while also putting in place stricter restrictions and measures to stem the spread of the virus.
Even with the best case scenarios, probably, you are in a very painful crisis, said Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan who was involved in the study.
The study was carried out by the COV-IND-19 Study Group of scholars and scientists looking into the threat posed by the coronavirus, and COVID-19, the disease it causes, in India.
The analysis first appeared on Medium, a US publishing platform, on Saturday.
India probably has only around 100,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 40,000 ventilators, said Dhruva Chaudhry, president of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, based on industry estimates and other data.
We can handle it if an even number (of cases) come over a period of time, Chaudhry said. But he warned that there was not sufficient infrastructure or staff to handle a sharp spike in critical patients.
India’s federal health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research did not respond to questions about the forecasts.
So far, India has reported over 500 cases of the coronavirus and 11 deaths, numbers dwarfed by countries like China, Italy and Spain, but which are nonetheless beginning to accelerate.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday declared a nationwide lockdown for three weeks to tackle the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus.
The original study was based on data up to March 16, but following a request from Reuters, the team updated their model using cases from Indian health authorities up to March 21.
The model was based on one used by colleagues to analyse the coronavirus outbreak in Hubei, China, and employed a set of equations taking into account the number of susceptible people, those infected and those who recovered.
