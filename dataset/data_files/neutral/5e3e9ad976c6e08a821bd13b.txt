After returning to France, the Wuhan woman posted a picture of eating and drinking in a restaurant in Lyon on the social network. She posted: "we'll have a good meal at last..." She narrated how she successfully passed the customs and entered France: "before departure, she had a low fever accompanied by a cough. She was scared to death, so she took the medicine and kept taking the temperature. Fortunately, the temperature dropped and the exit and entry were also very smooth.".
Later, the overseas doctoral circle issued an article criticizing that "a woman in Wuhan is in the circle of friends, excitedly exposing her excitement and" tricks "of successfully flying to France", referring to her "fluke in mind", "regardless of other people's and their own safety", criticizing "this" victory master ", which is frightening. If anything, it's really unthinkable.
A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in France said in a statement on Tuesday: "recently, our embassy received a number of calls or emails from Chinese citizens, saying that a Wuhan woman released information in a circle of friends, saying that she had fever and cough, forced to take antipyretic drugs to mix with airport tests and enter France. After learning the above information, our library attaches great importance to it. This evening, our library contacted Yan XX and asked him to call 15 French emergency rescue number as soon as possible and inform the relevant emergency department to handle it. "
French airports have been instructed to prevent the spread of the epidemic, French health minister Agnes Buzan said Tuesday. But she also said she was not prepared to take restrictive measures against passengers at this stage. There are direct flights between Wuhan and Paris.
