This Tuesday, the World Health Organisation (WHO) called on all European countries, without exception, for "bolder" measures to combat the threat of the new coronavirus, noting that Europe is currently the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic.
"All countries, without exception, must take bolder measures to halt or decrease the threat of the virus," said the WHO regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, in statements made from Copenhagen (Denmark).
The WHO Europe, which covers an area from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, comprises 53 countries and territories as diverse as Russia, Andorra, Germany or Tajikistan.
The new coronavirus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic has so far infected more than 180 thousand people, more than 7.000 dead.
From infected people around the world, over 75 thousand have recovered from the disease.
The outbreak began in China in December and spread over 145 countries and territories, which led the WHO to declare a pandemic situation.
After China, which records most cases, Europe became the epicenter of the pandemic, with more 67 thousand infected and at least 2.684 dead.
In Portugal, the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) has today elevated the number of confirmed cases of infection to 448, more 117 than on Monday, the day of the first death in the country.
