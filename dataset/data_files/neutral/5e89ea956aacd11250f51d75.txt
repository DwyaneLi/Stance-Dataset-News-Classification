Scientists in China studying the origin of the new coronavirus viral epidemic say they've discovered two major strains of the virus that may be causing infections. Researchers, from the Faculty of Life Sciences of the University of Beijing and the Shanghai Pasteur Institute, under the auspices of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, warn, however, that the study has examined a still limited amount of data and that more data is needed to better understand the evolution of the virus.
The preliminary study found that a more aggressive strain of the new coronavirus, associated with the outbreak in Wuhan city (Hubei province), corresponds to 70% of the samples analysed, while 30% was linked to a less aggressive strain. The prevalence of the most aggressive virus decreased in mid-January, they also reported.
"These results strongly support the urgent need for more comprehensive studies combining genetic data, epidemiological data and clinical records of patients'symptoms with Covid-19", wrote the team in an article published last Tuesday in the National Science Review of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
