The Baltic Dry Index, which monitors freight for the world's raw materials trade, fell this Tuesday to 546 points, the lowest level since April 2016.
In recent days, panic in the markets surrounding the progression of Wuhan's coronavirus has exacerbated the downward path of that international trade index.
The Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) said this Tuesday in Beijing that he trusts China's ability to avoid a pandemic. But the organization reviewed the risk of the virus from "moderate" to "very high" in China and "high" in the rest of the world.
Baltic Dry experienced a peak of 2518 points in September last year because importers anticipated purchases in the face of fears of escalating trade war between the United States and China, which would not happen. Washington and Beijing would sign a first-stage agreement as early as January of this year.
The'black swan'of Wuhan's coronavirus has exacerbated uncertainty about the march of the Chinese and world economy.
In Davos last week, the International Monetary Fund advanced an optimistic forecast on China's growth, pointing to a slight deceleration from 6.1% in 2019 to 6% in 2020- and with an acceleration of the world economy from 2,9% (the worst year since 2009) to 3,3%.
If Wuhan's coronavirus records a progression similar to the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) of 2002 and 2003, the growth of the Chinese economy may suffer a 1-point percentage cut, the British Economist Intelligence Unit advanced. The negative impact of this slowdown on the world economy will be important.
In the case of virus progression, maritime transport itself may be subject to quarantines of ports and ships and disruptions to global supply chains, they warn shipping companies.
