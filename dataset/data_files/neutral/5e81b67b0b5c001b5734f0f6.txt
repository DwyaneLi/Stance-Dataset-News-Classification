To protect against further infections with the new Coronavirus, returnees from Italy may not donate blood for four weeks to the German Red Cross and the Bavarian Red Cross blood donation services.
The time span will be calculated from the return, said spokesman Patric Nohe. For travellers from all over the People's Republic of China, as well as from North and South Korea, the blockade has been four weeks anyway, due to the Chikungunya virus.
It can be transmitted by mosquitoes and cause the tropical disease Chikungunyafever. "The incubation period of the new type Coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) is up to 14 days old and is therefore also covered by this measure," says Nohe.
After a stay abroad, there are often deadlines until the next blood donation. Depending on the destination, stay and travel time, these waiting periods ranged from four weeks to six months from return. The DRC's blood donation services cover the nationwide need for blood canning at 75 per cent. The Coronavirus had not yet brought about any restrictions. (dpa
