Enough to use some keywords: "hunt", "wild flavor" or "all natural". On some platforms most popular Chinese e-commerce was so far possible to find, delving a little more exotic meats. Like civet cat that served the transmitter to humans from the virus causing SARS in 2003 to 350 yuan (46 euros) per kilo. Or Peacock. O giant salamanders. It is not so easy, the least for a while. As a result of the new coronavirus Wuhan, transmitted to humans by an animal sold one of the markets of the city, the Chinese government has just banned though so far only provisionally-trade and transport of wild species.
The joint order issued by three official agencies, including the Ministry of Agriculture prohibits any trade with these animals, alive or dead, on any platform, but specifically mentions electronic commerce, restaurants, supermarkets or markets. Local authorities will increase inspections and punishments for those who violate the ban will be "severe". Farms breeding these animals will be quarantined.
"Consumers should fully understand the health risks of eating wild animals have to stay away from the wild taste and healthy eating," says the statement.
The step has been taken after scientists will trace the origin of the new coronavirus, which has caused the death of at the least 56 people and infected more than 2,000 in China alone-and more than thirty in the rest of the world to a market in Wuhan city, the epicenter of the infection. Although theoretically the market closed Huanan -today lime and song-was devoted to the sale of seafood, inside also they sold all kinds of animals caged. A price list that has circulated through social networks included a hundred species, from wolf pups urchins or camel meat. Also marmots, foxes and monkeys. Or snakes, mice, cats and dogs.
Scientists have failed to identify with certainty the species, but have determined that the coronavirus 2019-nCoV passed to humans through an animal. A group of Chinese scientists has published probably a snake; others believe it could be a bat.
An identical situation that triggered the SARS epidemic in 2003 scientists determined that the transmitter of that coronavirus -emparentado with that of Wuhan- had been civet meat sold in a market in Guangzhou. That focus eventually infecting 8,422 people and killing nearly 800.
Then, as now, trade was banned wild animals. But, as now, temporarily. Also decreased interest in the consumption of these meats. But so temporary.
China remains a voracious consumer of wildlife products to the point of increasing the risk of extinction of some species. Demand, either for food or for use in traditional medicine, it has grown in parallel with the prosperity of the country. Among certain sectors, eat the more exotic meats are difficult to obtain and is a way to display social position. In other cases, such as consumption of dog in Yulin festival in the south, eat that meat is almost an act of vindication of alleged national roots.
Markets such as Wuhan are not uncommon. An investigation that the newspaper Beijing News published last week found that, one month after the first infections were detected in Wuhan, it was still possible to find in different provinces markets willing to sell, restaurants willing to prepare and in Internet forums, consumers willing to pay whatever it takes for this kind of food.
The problem in these markets are not only hygienic conditions in which animals are kept, often deficient. Also the difficulty of establishing the origin of the specimens. Although there are farms engaged in the breeding of these species with a licensed She estimated that tiger welcome about 6,000 copies, activists complain that it is not uncommon trapped wild animals end up in any of them; or licenses have been obtained illegally.
Although the virulence of the outbreak of coronavirus Wuhan has made the voices against such practices multiply. Last week, 19 prominent scientists sent an open letter to the government asking for limitation of such trade. "It is not just important for ecological conservation, but for its great importance in controlling public health risks", warned. Experts also call for the "loopholes" are resolved in permits for domestication and breeding of wild animals, which allow traffickers to hunt wild animals and sell them in the market through farms.
"Viruses transmitted by animals are human pathogens that occur most frequently. Represent less than 15% of all known species of human pathogens, but more than 65% of pathogens discovered since 1980, "it said in a statement Christian Walzer, executive director of the NGO Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), headquartered in New York.
Wild meat consumption has also been the subject of heated debate in Chinese networks. "If humans do not live in harmony with nature, nature certainly we will hit back!" Said a user of Weibo, the Chinese Twitter.
So far, the prohibition arrives in Beijing is only temporary. This precise order issued Sunday that will last only "until no epidemic situation in the country".
WCS organizations such as the claim that is made permanent. Not only in China but worldwide. "If these markets continue, and human consumption of illegal wildlife without reglar continues, the public will continue to address increased risks of new viruses, potentially more lethal and sources of future pandemics," says Walzer.Enough to use some keywords: "hunt", "wild flavor" or "all natural".
