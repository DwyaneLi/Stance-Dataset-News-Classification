In early December, there was an epidemic. Why didn't you hold still
Wuhan pneumonia first appeared on December 8, 2019. Since December 31, a file of "emergency notice on reporting the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause" was circulated on the Internet. After the disclosure of the Internet, the authorities came forward to confirm it, and began to report the cases to the society, and pointed out that what kind of pneumonia it was. Authorities have been slow to act, Thailand, Japan and other countries outside China have burst out cases of infection, but in China, in addition to the previous warning of Guangdong 11 announced a suspected case, only Wuhan has confirmed cases.
What is more serious is that the Wuhan Public Security Bureau passed the public notice of "safe Wuhan" in January 1st. "Eight people who took a walk for Wuhan pneumonia were dealt with according to law". They refer to netizens' "sending false information" and "disturbing social order". This incident shows that the authorities should not only control the news, but also seal it up. Anyone who dares to maintain a different caliber with the authorities will be "dealt with according to law" as before. On January 14, there were more and more cases, and the international community was full of doubts. Taking advantage of the opportunity of Hong Kong experts to visit Wuhan, many Hong Kong Radio and television stations went for follow-up visits. When Hong Kong media went to Wuhan Jinyintan hospital to interview the epidemic situation that morning, they were taken away by the public security, and forced reporters to delete the contents of the hospital. The reporters were also required to hand over their phones and photographic equipment for examination, creating difficulties for a small time Release after.
On January 17, a male netizen named "Mr. Shu SSS" posted on his microblog, pointing out that all three members of his family were suspected to be infected with unidentified pneumonia. His father was isolated by Jinyintan hospital for treatment, and his mother was rejected by the hospital for no bed. He questioned the authorities' delay in treatment. After the incident attracted attention, the article was deleted and the microblog was blocked.
Questions raised by some experts
If there is a high degree of overseas attention to Wuhan pneumonia, and the World Health Organization is cautiously waiting for China to submit more detailed information, some expert comments quoted by Chinese media are also questioned.
Wang Guangfa, chief physician of the respiratory and critical care medicine department of the first hospital of Peking University, confirmed on the 21st that he had Wuhan pneumonia and was undergoing treatment. He was an expert of the national medical expert group. He once said to the official media on the new coronavirus in January 10th that he believed that according to the patient's condition and spread, the whole epidemic situation could be prevented and controlled. This sentence was widely questioned by the official endorsement.
。
Why there are only cases in Wuhan and none in other parts of China? Wang yuedan, deputy director of Immunology Department of Peking University, explained that he speculated that the virus was not detected in other parts of China. On January 20, the top authorities of the Communist Party of China made a statement. Wang yuedan explained to the media that there was no good detection method in the past, so some cases have not been confirmed for the time being. Now the detection method has been improved, and the number of new cases may increase sharply in the past two days. It has been seventeen years since the outbreak of SARS, and China's testing methods have not been improved. Xi Jinping has made a statement. Overnight, the detection method has suddenly improved. These are all questions of the people.
When does human to human transmission begin
As for "human to human transmission", the authorities denied it at the beginning. But some overseas experts have long pointed out that as long as it is a coronavirus, it should be assumed that human to human transmission should be started. The fact that human beings have been transmitted has proved to be a fact. 14 new medical staff have been infected with the new coronavirus pneumonia. But the authorities have been reluctant to say, when and under what circumstances were these medical staff infected?
Wuhan doesn't believe in tears? Wuhan authorities behave strangely
Wuhan authorities are not only suspected of delaying the outbreak, but also have staged two amazing dramas at a time when the outbreak is serious, transparency is lacking, people are in panic, and international concern.
On January 19, according to the report of Chutian daily, more than 40000 families participated in the "ten thousand banquets" held in Baibuting community of Wuhan City, each contributing 13986 dishes. On January 20, Wuhan city sent 200000 "tourist vouchers" to the whole city from that day, allowing citizens to "enjoy" 30 scenic spots in Wuhan such as yellow crane tower from the first to the 15th of the new year.
Wuhan is the port of tens of millions of people, and the flow of personnel is large, and it is in the Spring Festival. Hundreds of millions of people in China are moving, and Wuhan pneumonia is more and more suspicious of the possibility of human transmission. Wuhan, as the source of the epidemic, is holding such activities at this time. It is said that the municipal government is not only good at doing good deeds, but also to show the positive energy advocated by Xi Jinping Central Committee to the outside world. "Wuhan does not believe in tears." , which provides the best occasion for cross infection.
Now, General Secretary Xi said that Wuhan dialect has changed greatly, and netizens have ridiculed it as "if leaders don't give instructions, the epidemic will not exist."
Why Beijing turns a deaf ear to such a big thing as Wuhan
From December 8th to January 20th, Beijing's response was surprisingly slow
。 During the same period, the number of cases was limited, with no more than three deaths. In January 17th, Ferguson, an epidemiological medical expert at Imperial College London, estimated that the total number of new coronavirus cases in Wuhan, China, was 1723 cases as of January 12th. On 22, the director of the China Center for Disease Control and prevention, Gao Fu, responded that this was only the largest number of theories. On January 21, the medical school of the University of Hong Kong calculated through mathematical model that as of January 17, there may have been more than 1300 cases in Wuhan. This data is mutually confirmed with the calculation of Imperial College of London. At the same time, Liang zhuoxun, the dean of the school, calculated that there may have been more than 300 cases exported from Wuhan in various provinces and cities of China.
The biggest problem for the Chinese authorities is why they are so slow in response within 40 days. Whether it is due to the concealment of Wuhan authorities, or the slow progress of the investigation, or the deliberate delay of Beijing authorities in reporting and worrying about the impact on the overall situation of stability maintenance, has become another big question for Chinese netizens.
Why did Xi Jinping make his statement not later than twenty days?
Why the epidemic in Wuhan, widely known as China's pneumonia by the outside world, is far more serious than the official public description, and nearly out of control. Only after causing global concern, did it stir up China's top leaders? This is also a huge question.
The official Xinhua News Agency reported 19 days that Xi Jinping, the supreme leader of China, made the first statement on the pneumonia in Wuhan. He urged all Chinese governments to do a good job in epidemic prevention and control. It is particularly important to find out the causes of virus infection and spread as soon as possible and strengthen case monitoring, especially during the Spring Festival. Xi Jinping also stressed the need to "maintain overall social stability".
Xi Jinping did not know where and under what circumstances he issued "instructions". It was reported that Chinese Premier Li Keqiang subsequently made instructions to prevent epidemic spreading. According to the normal channels of the CPC, such a big thing, Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang should know at the first time, how dare the local authorities hide them?
Xi Jinping has been "directing" and "moving the mountains and shaking the mountains". The Chinese authorities and the Wuhan authorities have changed greatly, and the cases have suddenly increased, making the world stare. Zhong Nanshan, China's chief epidemiologist who resisted the establishment of SASS, was "re opened" to lead the "national high level expert group" to investigate the epidemic situation in Wuhan and returned to Beijing on the same day. "Now it can be said that there must be a phenomenon of people passing on people," Zhong Nanshan said in an interview with CCTV news one plus one on Tuesday
" On the same day, Yinglan, Secretary General of the Chinese society of nursing, announced on the Internet that the information obtained from the government's epidemic prevention and control meeting showed that the severity of the epidemic was more than expected, with a medium to severe rate of 14% and a death rate of 4%. The epidemic was similar to that of SARS, and it had been confirmed that the epidemic would spread to people, and there had been a cluster infection. The message has yet to be verified.
Data jumped, with 64 cases in Wuhan, 90 cases in Hong Kong, 3 cases outside China and zero cases in other provinces before the 17th. As soon as Xi Jinping spoke, everything was not at peace. Even the Central Committee of law and politics was hoarding to make a military order. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the number of deaths was 9, then increased to 17. The number of confirmed cases increased to more than 500 cases. The political and legal commissar of the CPC Central Committee said that Whoever conceals the report will be arrested. Whoever conceals the report will be the perpetrator of a long history. Some netizens said, "you should catch the arrested first and sentence several officials.".
Wuhan authorities act on color and boast that "Wuhan is a city that has constantly overcome difficulties. It is not the first time we have encountered similar situations.". "We firmly believe that with the care of general secretary Xi Jinping, the strong leadership and decision-making of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, with the careful arrangements of the provincial Party committee and the provincial government, we are all united in one mind, unite in one's strength and conscientiously do all the prevention and control work, so that we will be able to win the epidemic prevention and control war."
Why is the lesson of SARS forgotten?
After the case of Wuhan pneumonia came out in December, the network constantly issued a warning to be careful of the recurrence of SARS, calling on the Chinese government to learn from the past and learn from the past.
Seventeen years ago, the SARS epidemic broke out in Guangdong Province of China, also known as SARS. China concealed it for the first time, causing the epidemic to spread to the world.
What is the lesson of SARS? Thanks to the unwillingness to disclose the truth and the death of the CPC authorities to maintain stability, fortunately, a brave man like Dr. Jiang Yanyong was able to disclose the truth of SASAS to the world after his ineffective response through normal channels.
On April 3, 2003, at a press conference held by the Information Office of the State Council, Zhang Wenkang, China's minister of health, vowed to face the mass media reporters: "there are only 12 SARS cases and 3 deaths in Beijing. SARS in China has been effectively controlled. " He further said: "welcome to China to travel and negotiate business. I guarantee everyone's safety. It's safe to wear masks or not."
The first reaction of Jiang Yanyong, a military doctor in 301 Hospital, was: "I think the figures provided by Zhang Wenkang are far from the real situation
" On the evening of April 4, Jiang Yanyong wrote down what he knew and gave them to CCTV 4 and Phoenix TV respectively according to the email address he saw on TV. The last sentence of his letter was: "all the materials I have provided are true, and I am responsible for everything." There was no response in China in the next few days, but Jiang Yanyong's information was learned by foreign media, and the news of severe SARS epidemic spread all over the world. On April 17, Hu Jintao, general secretary of the Communist Party of China, stressed that no one is allowed to conceal or falsely report the epidemic situation. On April 12, Zhang Wenkang, Minister of health, and Meng Xuenong, deputy secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party committee, were removed. Because of the ups and downs of Dr. Jiang Yanyong's life, who always insisted on being the real name of 64, he was widely praised for "being used to disclose the truth of SARS epidemic, thus saving many lives",
Xu Zhiyuan, a well-known cultural person, wrote: "17 years ago, I was a new reporter, and felt that SARS forced China to rethink its governance model, and I could express my feelings to the New York Times. Now I think that the last crisis also includes doctors like Jiang Yanyong, Zhong Nanshan, journalists like Chai Jing, and a large number of tracking media. Now it seems that only Caixin magazine continues to report normally. The most successful part of this system is the destruction of honest people, trustworthy institutions, and the ability of a society to narrate itself. There is only one arrogant power and a jumble of information and fragile, lonely, angry individuals
The Xi Jinping administration may not be directly responsible for the development of pneumonia in Wuhan. However, who has created such a social and political environment, officials only want to promote the promotion, just want to ensure positive energy according to the requirements, all serve the maintenance of stability, try to suppress the problems encountered, and encounter the public opinion as far as possible. Today, China's social environment is not as open as it was in the SARS era. The media are more and more afraid to speak, and the rights lawyers are being suppressed one by one. Whose responsibility is all this?
The epidemic is still developing in Wuhan. From Thursday, the operation of urban public transport, subway, ferry and long-distance passenger transport has been suspended, and the airport and railway station have been temporarily closed to stop the spread of the epidemic. Some people hope that at least the authorities can report the real situation of the spread of pneumonia in Wuhan to the world in a truthful and timely manner.
