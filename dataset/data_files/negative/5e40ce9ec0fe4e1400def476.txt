The spread of the mysterious lung disease in China may be much greater than previously known. The British Center for the Analysis of Global Infectious Diseases at Imperial College London estimates the true number of infected to more than 1700's. Experts also warn against a transfer from person to person. However, the central Chinese metropolis of Wuhan reported only that the new corona virus had been discovered in 17-year-old lung patients. The number of confirmed cases in China is thus increasing to 62. Two patients have died so far.
