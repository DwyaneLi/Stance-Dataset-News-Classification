Human Rights Watch (HRW) pointed out this Thursday "major problems" to China's response to the outbreak of the new coronavirus found in China, denouncing that Beijing's conduct has only worsened the spread of the strain, which has already made 563 dead. There were major problems in China's response to the coronavirus that aggravated the outbreak", said HRW director Kenneth Roth in statements to the media in Geneva (Switzerland), pointing, among other failures, to the mass execution of quarantines.
Kenneth Roth also denounced as problems the "elimination" of reports on the presence of the virus in China during the early days of the outbreak, as well as Beijing's efforts to silence criticism, which was largely disseminated via social networks, against the contingency plan drawn up by the authorities.
"There is no room for secrecy in the fight against an epidemic", Roth said, that in the middle of January last year he was prevented from entering Hong Kong, China's administrative region, where he planned to present the annual report of the non-governmental organisation (NGOs) for the defence of human rights.
"The time has come for total transparency, even if it is embarrassing, because public health must come before the preservation of a particular political power. Unfortunately, that is not the Beijing approach", the HRW director continued.
The new virus (2019-nCoV) belongs to the same family as the acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), which struck five.327 people between November 2002 and August of 2003 and was responsible for 800 deaths, the vast majority in China.
Currently, and according to most recent official data, more than 28.000 people are infected with the new coronavirus in China, where several cities have imposed drastic measures of containment on tens of millions of people
Yeah.
One of these cities is Wuhan, in Hubei Province (central China), where the new virus was first identified and where the epicenter of the outbreak is identified. According to Kenneth Roth, this kind of quarantine "usually doesn't work."
"The quarantines recommended by public health authorities are far more targeted. They are targeted at people who have been identified as carriers of the virus", stressed the representative, insisting:"People need to be fed, housed, cared for and there are huge gaps in the Chinese government's response to these individual needs".
Also today, International Amnesty (AI) has focused on how the issue of human rights must be safeguarded in the face of the current outbreak. Today, the AI has called on governments to avoid violating the human rights of citizens while attempting to contain and eliminate the outbreak of the new coronavirus.
The international organisation has, for example, warned against increased use of censorship, arbitrary arrests or other restrictions, calling on the authorities to ensure that all infected people have access to health care.
One of the greatest risks of the current situation involves potential attitudes of discrimination and xenophobia, actions stemming from the fear of contagion, whether inside or outside Chinese territory. According to information collected by Amnesty International, there are reports of people who have been rejected in hotels, who are held as prisoners in the own homes or who have seen their personal data published on the Internet without authorization.
"The Chinese government must take steps to protect people from discrimination, while governments around the world must adopt a zero-tolerance approach to racist acts targeting people of Chinese and Asian origin," stated the regional director of the AI for Southeast Asia and East Asia, Nicholas Bequelin
Yeah.
In addition to the mainland territory of China and the Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, there are other cases of infection of the new coronavirus confirmed in more than twenty countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared in mid-January an international public health emergency, which presupposes the adoption of worldwide prevention and coordination measures.
