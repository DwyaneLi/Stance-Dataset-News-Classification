The Coronavirus in China has given me the most extraordinary spring break I've ever had. I read and hear from afar from empty streets in cities, little fireworks, but a lot of fear everywhere, even anger. Travel restrictions make it difficult for people to travel home to their families. The spring festivals I remember now seem to me like a dream of a hundred years ago. It fills me with almost nostalgic feelings.
As a Chinese immigrant, I usually have much more opportunities to celebrate in Germany in the winter than the Germans themselves: Christmas and New Year's I also have the Chinese Spring Festival or the Chinese New Year's Festival, which starts between the end of January and mid-February with the change of year (this time it fell to the 25. January), 15 days long and ends with sweet rice leaves and the lantern feast. The Germans, on the other hand, are fighting back from the 2nd. January with its post-holiday depression around, Easter still hardly appears as light at the end of a very long and cold tunnel. My holiday mood, on the other hand, lasts one or even two months, because the lantern festival takes place in the middle of late February.
For a Chinese woman living abroad like me, Chinese New Year's festivities are now a virtual thing anyway. Through the social media, I have watched from afar over the past few years how China, in the two weeks of the Spring Festival, comes to an almost complete standstill, respectively turning into a huge, ever faster merry-go-round: people travel home to where their families live
Yeah. The eleven months of the year, filled with work and competition until the attack, pass into a month filled with alcohol and equally intense family competition. The flood of travellers usually flows in all directions all over the country, it is briefly the largest human hiking movement in the world: three billion trips to family reunion have been counted during the Spring Festival 2019, to land, to water or in the air were the nearly 1,4 billion Chinese women and Chinese on the way.
For Europeans, the idea of such a huge number of travellers may sound abstract, but for me, it combines the memory of an intense physical experience when I was still living in China. It always started at least a month earlier when I was fighting for plane, train and bus tickets to be home on time, competing with millions of Chinese travellers who are no less eager to travel. Then the same contest, the fight for a taxi to be at the airport or train station in time; standing for at least two to three security checks, with subtle or not so subtle elbow use or strategic positioning to prevent others from pushing forward; buttons and truffles, because I did not move forward fast enough; occasionally fighting and fighting over the seat on the train, even though I had the ticket with the reservation and the one who was sitting there just did not... Cleaning agents on marble or concrete floors, the tension of people like charcoal smoke in the air.
The spring festivities did not really begin until, for example, the train started to move slowly. Facilitation and happiness
Yeah. Soon the passengers on the train opened their pockets, and the smell of all kinds of food soon swept through the wagons. The less luxurious the trip was, the more food and drinks were shared among the passengers. People asked each other about their professions, families, family status and income, made appropriate sympathetic noises or gave unsolicited tips on how to deal with private problems. As a young woman, it was all moving and unsettling for me at the same time.
Over the years, I have been offered not only delicious food on spring break, but also visits to foreigners and even a few potential husbands. However, the meeting that impressed me the most took place in a long-distance bus. A young woman in the seat next to me, barely awake from a long sleep, put her elbow on my shoulder and began brushing her hair. I behaved quietly and let myself be used as her hairdresser without resistance throughout the process. She seemed to me to be a migrant worker. Maybe she was lonely, and I was just shy. We didn't say a word.
Since I could afford plane and express train tickets, there have been no more intimate encounters of this kind. The trips to the Spring Festival have become less challenging and much more orderly. The good mobile phone connections along the route in recent years have made it possible to listen increasingly to video and gaming noises, telephone calls and chats via social media instead of conversations between fellow travellers. What has not changed until the end is the ubiquitous smell of food. I really scared a German friend on one of my spring break trips to date when I unpacked my package of seasoned duck feet at Shanghai express station
Yeah. This is the last remaining national pride I haven't gotten rid of.
It took some courage in the past to return to the homeland when young people who had moved away but had not yet definitively arrived elsewhere. In ancient China, they said the closer you get to your hometown, the more nervous you get. In the West, these mixed feelings have been familiar to people since Christmas. You never know what tests your parents or relatives will put you through. This mixture of longing for return and fear of such attacks is called "Shredder Spring Festival." Thus it is said in the foreplay of a song that is very popular among young cities in China, tips for self-help at the Spring Festival, sung by the rainbow enchor from Shanghai. The hashtag named after the song title on Douban, one of the largest social media platforms, is now also very popular, 2,5 million hits and more than a thousand tips.
Of course, families who claim to have their children's benefits do not only exist in China, but the idea of competition and the shameless crossing of borders can be more overwhelming than in Europe: as the foreigners on the train, older relatives also like to ask about the income of the younger ones during the spring feast, according to dates and marriage plans, according to the details of birth plans, education plans for the babies, once again there are free advice without question. It is also not unusual that your weight, the length of your legs and neck, your diet, your skin are being commented on. Of course, all out of concern.
When the boasting (and only to the outside) of proud parents starts, the bets spin on the table during the game
Yeah. The son has been promoted, the other has a fat baby; one daughter has given her parents a luxurious apartment, the other has taken the parents on a European trip... to give the wishes of blessing in the form of money in red envelopes (or Hongbao) to the children and the elderly. This is the final, brutal commitment: prosperity.
In recent years, however, the Internet empire Tencent has changed the competition in Hong Kong. At the Spring Festival 2014, Tencent has launched a new in-app service called WeChat Hongbao in his social media app WeChat. As digital payments are made everywhere, this immediately became a success: 823 million participants used the service at the Spring Festival 2019. For members of a group chat, WeChat Hongbao even offers the possibility to compete with the same Hongbao.
WeChat has consequently changed an old Chinese custom in three respects. On the one hand, the habit used to dictate only that money is distributed to family members, but now you are somehow obliged to consider friends and colleagues as well. Secondly, many Internet companies are now also giving their users digital Hong Kong for customer loyalty purposes. This year, the Kuaishou short film platform will transfer Hong Kong to a billion Yuan (almost 130 million euros). And thirdly, the geographical distance is no longer a reason to refrain from handing over the red envelopes, which now goes from anywhere in the world, no matter where you live, and be it on the island of Palau.
During the holiday week since then, many Chinese have been staring at their phones to capture some of the happiness. Soon new apps were created to help greedy people automatically access the digital envelopes of companies
Yeah. I have not won a competition so far, because I have been too far away in recent years: whenever I discovered the envelopes on the screen, someone had already emptied them in China. With these false promises, it is like with distant stars in the sky: what I see is only the memory of the long past. And yet I also have to distribute my honeycombs online. Luckily WeChat has set a maximum limit for the sum of each red envelope in a chat group: 200 Yuan, about 26 euro.
But it is not only immigrants who are watching from afar during the spring feast. The gathering of a large, omitted crowd is the core of worldly happiness in Chinese society, but more and more people have had enough of it. Some wealthy, but also some middle-class families, today take overseas holidays to escape the noise, traffic and air pollution of China, which, for example, bring with them many fireworks during the spring feast. The countries of Southeast Asia and Japan are the favorite destinations that really prefer rich and worldly people even further corners of the planet. But wherever they flee, most of them stay connected to WeChat to post photos and videos and chat with friends and relatives. This is a slightly different spring formal contest. The further away from home you are, the better. I'm staying exactly where I am, and that's quite a feat, too.
I started boycotting a traditional spring festival, the New Year's gala of China Central TV. This television show was created 1983 by the government leader, the common reputation after the opulent time has long become an indispensable element of the family celebration
Yeah. I grew up with it and gradually lost the taste of it when my political thinking and ethical standards changed. I learned from the stories behind the stage: from the famous director who went to prison for accepting bribes; one after the other the beautiful singers became lovers of political leaders; popular comedians were thrown out of the show and were not allowed to appear on any other show, Ugly power games are unavoidable in a show that aims to seduce and shape the souls of 1,4 billion people on New Year's Day.
There have been some calls this year to cancel the show due to the outbreak of the new Coronavirus. She then walked across the stage without much mention of the sick and dying. In the net, this was commented sharply as "disco dance on the graves". Many younger people reported in social media about their disgust before the Healing World Show. A small but growing crowd of young people, especially in the big cities, can no longer tolerate the gala, its embarrassing aesthetics, forced cheerfulness, the demonstrative display of love for the army and party, the gender stereotypes, the celebration of the traditional family. Not the slightest bit of negativity or criticism is allowed, love and happiness are obligatory: look at the grandiose overall picture of the nation and forget any pain. And the parents are always right and full of care, as are the party and its army.
In villages and small towns everything looks a little different. The younger migrant workers have an additional obligation during the spring holidays: they are sent to blind dates prepared by families and professional marriage mediators for them
Yeah. They have to find a husband or wife in these ten days, because they usually do not have a holiday in the rest of the year. Blind dates arranged by the family have been the norm in China for centuries. It was only with the founding of the People's Republic that this tradition slowly died out. In the country, however, marriage has resurrected as a prosperous industry in the last decade, in response to the bitter reality of migrant working life. In this respect, too, 2020 is an exceptional year: access to many small towns and villages is blocked in order to prevent infection with the Coronavirus. This is also the case with this year's marriage mediation.
The blind date industry is also thriving in the country because the ratio of female births to male births in China has a clear imbalance in favour of boys. China ranks 106 of 153 states in the current Global Gender Gap Index: the abortion of female fetuses or even the killing of female newborns is so widespread in some areas that young men hardly find partners anymore. Professional marriage became such a thing of necessity, only commercial institutes have the time to look for the few girls.
Many reports describe the very direct selection procedures by which these dates are arranged. On a hectic day, a young woman can be reunited with more than a dozen men. It is then necessary to obtain information from applicants on cars, houses, income, body size, appearance, character, under the strict supervision of parents and other relatives. It sounds like a fun shopping experience: husband-jumping. However, given the poor status of a wife in the village and the lack of institutional protection against domestic violence, marriage is a risky and burdensome affair for women.
Yeah. The smart girls marry a man with older sisters because they are usually obliged to support the younger brother financially in the country. Very brave young women refuse to marry, others go into town and work hard for their financial independence. But during the spring feast, even these rebellious women travel back to their parents and bring them money and gifts.
From the third day of the new moon, people gradually return to their jobs. Once again the hectic efforts to get the bus, train or flight, but now in the state of food coma. Some are sad, most are rather relieved. After all, most of us have moved to the larger cities with good reason to study and work. Freedom and independence are seductive.
I have read many old poems about the Spring Festival, about poets who had left their homelands. Most describe sadness and homesickness. Traditional Chinese have always seen leaving home as the greatest tragedy in life. China has obviously changed, despite all the apparent nostalgia for a glorious but stoned past. There will be more and more who identify with the modern spirit of the poet Meng Haoran from the Tang dynasty: "I roam the world and have my pleasure wherever I am, I do not care about the old years that have passed" (234583d; "385433d;"22788;"19981d;"352653d;"24230d;)
In times of plague threat, even this pleasure is over. All that remains is a feeling of helplessness and anger towards a government that does not protect its citizens, but deliberately collapses.
