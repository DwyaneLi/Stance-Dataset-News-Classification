The number of patients with the novel corona virus behind lung disease in China has risen sharply again. Four infections have been confirmed in Germany. The three new cases announced on Tuesday evening are related to the first patient in Bavaria who had contracted it from a colleague from China. In the People's Republic the number of diseases increased within one day to Wednesday at 1459. This covers more than 6000 cases. Other 26 patients died in China. Thus the total number of deaths climbed to 132.
While there are a little more than 80-year-old infections outside the People's Republic, the Health Commission in Beijing counted patients alone in China until Wednesday around 5951. There are almost ten thousand suspicious cases. The Commission even reported cases of 5974, but counted 23 infections in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao. Beijing regards these territories as part of the People's Republic. Therefore, 1239 patients are severely ill. Deaths are usually older patients with pre-existing illnesses.
Outside the People's Republic there are also people with the new virus in Thailand, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, the USA, Australia or South Korea. In Europe, four cases have also been confirmed in France. Most of the patients were previously in China. However, there are also increasingly infections that have occurred outside in contact with travellers from China, such as most recently in Japan and Taiwan. Thus, the Beijing government has advised its citizens to postpone travel abroad for the time being.
In China, the eleven million metropolis of Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei in Central China are particularly hard hit. Around 45 million people were shot to death there. Flights and short- and long-distance transport have been suspended
Yeah. Japan began to bring back first compatriots from the area. A charter machine with 206 people from Wuhan landed in Tokyo on Wednesday.
The passengers did not use the normal flight terminal for regular passengers, but were taken to a medical facility in a special bus. More flights will follow, as around 650-Japanese want to return. Germany and other countries, such as the USA, South Korea or India, are also considering, or are already planning, concrete similar recovery actions. In Wuhan there are about 90-Germans. How many of them want to go to Germany is unclear. Australia, too, wants to expel citizens from the crisis region, but to quarantine them for a 14-day period on Christmas Island.
According to the Bavarian Ministry of Health, as in the first case, the three new patients in Germany are also employees of the car supplier Webasto in Stockdorf (Bavaria). "It has been decided that the three new patients at the Munich clinic Schwabing will also be admitted stationary and medically monitored and isolated," the ministry said. "Some other contact persons are currently undergoing a test to see if there is also an infection with the Coronavirus."
Because of the infections, Webasto closes its headquarters in the Upper Bavarian village of Stockdorf, a part of Gauting, until Sunday. Until then, employees of the company headquarters should also not travel to national and international locations, as the company announced on Tuesday evening. Webasto is a major supplier for the automotive industry with a total of 13 400 employees at 50-locations worldwide. There are twelve locations in China, one of them in Wuhan. The infected Chinese woman who had come to the company seminar had contracted it with her parents in the city. She did not develop symptoms until returning to China on the 23rd. January
Yeah.
In the fight against the virus, new reporting obligations are being imposed on airlines and hospitals in Germany, according to Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU). In the case of flights from China, pilots should inform the Tower of the health of the passengers prior to landing. Travellers from China should provide information on their flight, whereabouts and accessibility in the next thirty days in forms. Clinics will also have to report cases of Coronavirus suspicion to the Robert Koch Institute in the future, not just confirmed cases.
The first patient with the new virus in Germany, a 33-year-old from Landsberg am Lech district, is being treated at the isolation station at the Munich clinic Schwabing, as Clemens Wendtner, chief physician at the clinic, said. He's all right. The incubation period is up to two weeks in the case of lung disease. However, infected people are already contagious even before they show symptoms, which makes it particularly difficult to contain the virus.
The new virus 2019-nCoV originated probably from a market in Wuhan, where it probably jumped from there traded wild animals to humans. Symptoms, including dry cough, fever and shortness of breath, can be alleviated with medication. According to current experts, lung disease appears to be mild in most cases, in some cases even without symptoms. The new pathogen is very similar to the virus behind the Sars pandemic 2002/2003, which also broke out in China. Back then, 8000-year-old people were sick. Barely 800 died.
Australian scientists have been breeding the Coronavirus in the laboratory. The Peter Doherty Institute for Infections and Immunity in Melbourne reported this on Wednesday. It is now possible to work together with other institutes and the World Health Organisation on an antidote. (dpa)
